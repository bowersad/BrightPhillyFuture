Think of it like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IC8VF10/\">Shackleton&#8217;s Voyage</a> (a great recommendation from <a href=\"http://toni.org/\">Toni</a>) but on Mars. I really enjoyed the book, and if you like geeky, science-filled novels you will too.  One thing about the publishing I thought was really cool, as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)\">the Wikipedia puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having been rebuffed by literary agents when trying to get prior books published, Weir decided to put the book online in serial format one chapter at a time for free at his website. At the request of fans he made an Amazon Kindle version available through Amazon.com at 99 cents (the minimum he could set the price). The Kindle edition rose to the top of Amazon&#8217;s list of best-selling science-fiction titles, where it sold 35,000 copies in three months, more than had previously downloaded it for free. This garnered the attention of publishers: Podium Publishing, an audiobook publisher, signed for the audiobook rights in January 2013. Weir sold the print rights to Crown in March 2013 for six figures.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was hoping it was on a WordPress blog, but <a href=\"http://www.galactanet.com/writing.html\">it appears to be more of a static HTML site</a> (his <a href=\"http://www.andyweirauthor.com/\">official site is WP-powered</a>) and includes some awesome short vignettes like <a href=\"http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/meetingsarah.html\">Meeting Sarah</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 May 2015 10:54:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Why Cloudup is Not Replacing the WordPress Media Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"http://wptavern.com/why-cloudup-is-not-replacing-the-wordpress-media-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4027:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CloudUpFeaturedImage2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42250\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CloudUpFeaturedImage2.png?resize=650%2C200\" alt=\"CloudUpFeaturedImage2\" /></a>When <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/cloudup-joins-the-automattic-family/\">Automattic acquired Cloudup</a> in 2013, two of the most exciting parts <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/\">of the announcement</a> was replacing the WordPress media library with <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/\">Cloudup</a> and the ability to co-edit posts similar to Google Docs. We <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/cloudup-makes-file-sharing-incredibly-easy\">discussed the concept</a> in early 2014 and readers were concerned about owning their data.</p>\n<p>Two years later, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/04/smith/\">WordPress media library and the visual post editor</a> have received major improvements while integration with Cloudup is non-existent. When Matt Mullenweg was asked about the integration in a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-194-celebrating-wordpress-12th-birthday-with-matt-mullenweg\">recent interview</a>, he responded,</p>\n<blockquote><p>We did a lot of really awesome UI improvements to the editor and did some things we were very excited about, but because we weren&#8217;t working on a TinyMCE base, some of the basic editing stuff was really difficult.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team spent about six months to complete the first 80% of the project then spent a year and a half to reach 85%. Setbacks included a lot of rabbit holes and hidden complexity. The team now works on different things within Automattic that revolve around data.</p>\n<h2>Zeditor is an Educational Resource</h2>\n<p>The work completed by the team is <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/zeditor\">open source and available on GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s called Zeditor and serves as an educational resource. &#8220;We learned a ton through the way we architected the JavaScript and we think it serves as a good model for doing lots of JavaScript projects going forward,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Listen to Mullenweg explain why Cloudup is not replacing the WordPress media library in the following audio clip.

When asked about the project in a recent interview, Matt Mullenweg explained that despite loving the project and truly believing in it, work on o2 has shifted to other parts of WordPress.com to focus on the service&#8217;s core products.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Saying no is one of the hardest things but I think that&#8217;s where great design comes from is when you say no to a thousand things, including the things you love, or you really wanted to do. Saying no to the lame stuff is easy, but saying no to something you really believe in like o2 is much harder but that focus is crucial for creating great products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Mullenweg says anyone on WordPress.com can enable o2, this is not the case. Searching for o2 on WordPress.com generates no results while P2 brings up the original P2 theme.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/o2ThemeNotFound.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44513\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/o2ThemeNotFound.png?resize=921%2C312\" alt=\"o2 Theme Not Found\" /></a>o2 Theme Not Found\n<p>o2 is used internally at Automattic and the code is available via <a href=\"https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe/\">WordPress.com&#8217;s subversion repository</a>. o2 is not listed since it was supposed to be a plugin but the work inside of o2 is listed under P2 Breathe.

Founders <a href=\"http://muneebali.com\" target=\"_blank\">Muneeb Ali</a> and <a href=\"http://shea.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Shea</a> are pioneering decentralized identity with the long-term goal of creating decentralized authentication.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, BNS debuted <a href=\"https://passcard.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Passcard</a>, a digital form of identity and access control combined. It&#8217;s essentially a digital passport, secured by the blockchain, that allows you to control and display your identity.</p>\n<p>A few months ago,  <a href=\"https://www.larrysalibra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Salibra</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.pay4bugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pay4Bugs</a>, released a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-openname-avatars-to-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">plugin that adds Openname avatars to WordPress</a>. An ardent fan of blockchain technology, Salibra has just released another plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nametiles/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> that adds Passcard profiles and tagging to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Nametiles works like this: Type the plus character and a person&#8217;s +passname on a post or page and it will automatically display that person&#8217;s Passcard profile information when you hover over the link.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nametiles-example.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nametiles-example.jpg?resize=920%2C739\" alt=\"nametiles-example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44449\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin also includes the ability for registered users on your site to optionally use their Passcard avatar via a setting in wp-admin/profile.php.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nametiles.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> site has a live demo of how the tiles appear on your website. You can also see Nametiles in action on the <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong’s website</a>, where it&#8217;s in use on the <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/members/\" target=\"_blank\">members</a> page and <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/2015-inside-bitcoins-discount/\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a>.</p>\n<p>Salibra created Nametiles to help publishers keep people&#8217;s information and links continually up-to-date. Its two primary benefits for publishers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile information is never stale and always up-to-date (including website, bio, social links, avatar, etc)</li>\n<li>Users control their information and personal brand via Passcard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Publishers have no idea when the people mentioned or linked on their blog update their profile pic, bio, or website and no practical way to find out,&#8221; Salibra said. &#8220;The result is a site littered with broken links and out of date information that conveys sloppiness and apathy to visitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This plugin is especially useful for sites that often have guest post authors, as well as news and organization sites that frequently reference names in content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Nametiles, profile information about those you mention on your site is always up to date because the information is maintained by those who care most, the owners of the information,&#8221; Salibra said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for a future where digital identity is something we own instead of something big social companies use to pull visitors from our blogs and websites and track people,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The only catch is that users who are linked have to be registered for a <a href=\"https://passcard.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Passcard</a> profile. The blockchain-powered identity service is free but it is also so new that it hasn&#8217;t yet caught on.</p>\n<p>The idea of Passcard is similar to <a href=\"https://en.gravatar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravatar</a> but has the potential to be more powerful, as it is secured by the blockchain and may eventually support decentralized authentication. If Passcard founders are successful in building the future of identification, it may be a long before the identity system is mainstream enough for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nametiles/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> plugin to be useful beyond certain niche websites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 May 2015 00:35:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Money and Motivation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45104\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/money-and-motivation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"<p><a href=\"http://intenseminimalism.com/2012/the-misconception-about-money-and-motivation/\">The Misconception about Money and Motivation</a>, a good summary of the work by Dan Pink, Dan Ariely, and others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 May 2015 00:23:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Sucuri is Building a Comprehensive Alternative to CloudFlare\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://wptavern.com/sucuri-is-building-a-comprehensive-alternative-to-cloudflare\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4812:\"<p><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Sucuri</a> launched a new free performance tool today.

Like most things we do, the performance tool was a tool to satisfy our own needs.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Sucuri Is Expanding to Accommodate Plans for a Full-Featured CloudFlare Alternative</h3>\n<p>Sucuri is currently managing over 40 billion page views per month via its WAF network. The team is working on expanding to a full WAF/CDN solution to serve performance-related features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fundamental difference is that it&#8217;s security first, performance second,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;So yes, in the coming months you&#8217;ll see more as our solution blossoms into a full WAF/CDN solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Up until now the company has been limited by using a leased architecture but is making changes to support the WAF/CDN expansion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re actively migrating from a leased architecture to our own infrastructure, giving us full control of the website,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;This gives us optimal control to mitigate all attacks, including large scale DDOS attacks; a by-product of that will be performance in the form of a global CDN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sucuri is is building its own DNS architecture with full DNS management within its application.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users will have an alternative to solutions like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CloudFlare</a>,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;The fundamental difference being we&#8217;re a security company first.</p>\n<p>Sucuri is building its expansion on top of the an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast\" target=\"_blank\">Anycast</a> network, which means that users&#8217; requests will be routed to the nearest node on request.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With most of the content cached at the edge it&#8217;ll be designed for optimal speeds regardless of where you are in the world,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;That&#8217;s perhaps the biggest feature &#8211; most everything comes down to our design and configuration and how we handle the traffic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked if he sees the final WAF/CDN solution to be a comprehensive Cloudflare alternative, Perez responded, &#8220;Oh hell yeah &#8211; with one key differentiator: we&#8217;ll clean the mess too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea is when you think of Sucuri it&#8217;s a complete package &#8211; Protection &#8211; Detection &#8211; Response. It&#8217;s all built in-house, no third-party integrations,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cleaning is the one thing that no one else can match us on, it&#8217;s either too much liability or they haven&#8217;t figured out how to scale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sucuri&#8217;s WAF service is currently used by iThemes, Gravity Forms, List25, and many others in the WordPress space. If the company is able to deliver on their CloudFlare alternative, which is planned for this summer, customers will have the opportunity to get their security services bundled in with the new performance-enhancing features of the CDN.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 May 2015 19:23:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: Fast Page Switch Adds a Quick Way to Switch Between Pages in the WordPress Backend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44405\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"http://wptavern.com/fast-page-switch-adds-a-quick-way-to-switch-between-pages-in-the-wordpress-backend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1232:\"<p>If you find yourself editing pages often and want a quick way to switch between them without visiting the All Pages screen first, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-page-switch/\">Fast Page Switch</a> plugin by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marclarr/\">Marc Wiest</a>.</p>\n<p>Fast Page Switch adds a metabox with a drop down menu to the Page editing screen that allows you to quickly switch to a different page.

The hotly debated topic concerns what is permissible in terms of &#8220;content creation&#8221; for themes that are hosted in the official directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that CPTs and custom taxonomies are off-limits; likewise with non-presentational post custom meta data,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But what about content created via theme options, custom widgets, etc.?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This question often comes up in relation to themes that offer static front pages with custom widgets or textareas in the customizer where users can add small blocks of text. For example, a theme might offer a biography section or a place to enter copyright text. The concern is that a user is entering content, not knowing that it will be lost upon switching themes.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has had an <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1432668662001049\" target=\"_blank\">established policy for years</a> that forbids theme authors from defining the generation of user content. However, due to disorganization during the process of moving the official version of theme requirements from the Codex to the Theme Review Handbook, this particular guideline was omitted.</p>\n<p>Bennett posted a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/05/27/theme-review-requirements-and-documentation/\" target=\"_blank\">review of Theme Review Requirements and documentation</a> today on the Make/Themes blog with previously omitted items highlighted in red for clarity.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Presentation vs. Functionality</strong><br />\nSince the purpose of Themes is to define the presentation of user content, Themes must not be used to define the generation of user content, or to define Theme-independent site options or functionality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As this is a fairly general statement, the Theme Review Team will be discussing the finer points of how it applies during the next meeting. In the past, this guideline has been subjectively and inconsistently applied, allowing many themes to slip by with functionality that falls into these grey areas.</p>\n<h2>Theme Review Team to Begin Aggressively Enforcing &#8220;No Content Creation&#8221; Guideline</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/\" target=\"_blank\">Zerif Lite</a>, one of the top themes on WordPress.org, was highlighted during the meeting as an example of a theme that has been permitted to skirt this guideline, among others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking at Zerif Lite: testimonials, our team, our focus, about us &#8211; these are all CPTs, disguised as custom widgets,&#8221; Bennett said. In a <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24907\" target=\"_blank\">ticket where the theme is currently being reviewed for updates</a>, Bennett encouraged Zerif Lite&#8217;s author to remove any custom post meta data, except for that that which is presenatational, as it falls into plugin territory. This includes aspects of the theme such as author details, team member position, social network profiles, etc.</p>\n<p>Reviewers are already aggressively cracking down on Zerif Lite&#8217;s violation of this specific guideline and will likely extend their vigilance to uphold the guideline more consistently with all themes as they come up for review.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codeinwp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codeinwp</a>, the company behind Zerif Lite, replied to Bennetts&#8217; requests on the ticket:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of the things that you are pointing out are really sensitive for two reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Probably 50% of the most popular themes use some custom content on the homepage</li>\n<li>A lot of things like contact issue or testimonial can&#8217;t be solved without breaking 100k sites which use the theme</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Codeinwp contends that the approach used in Zerif Lite is far more user friendly than having to install a plugin, or multiple plugins, in order to add small bits of text to the home page.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end I agree that our approach was a bit different/radical. However, it looks like it is something that people really want (Zerif is one of the hottest themes at the moment, with mentions all over the web). I mean most of them want to build a beautiful site in 10 minutes, without any knowledge and with Zerif Lite they can easily do it. They don&#8217;t want 10 CPT, 10 required plugins, contact form, and Captcha plugins for a simple site.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme author believes that creating a plugin to handle four of the theme&#8217;s focus widgets would simply waste users&#8217; time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, you realize the amount of work required to do this for 100+ themes installed on million of sites, right?&#8221; Codeinwp said. The author also cited several other examples of popular themes in violation, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/accesspress-parallax/\" target=\"_blank\">AccessPress Parallax</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/onetone/\" target=\"_blank\">Onetone</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/colorway\" target=\"_blank\">Colorway</a>.</p>\n<p>Given that the WordPress.org theme directory is riddled with violations of what is purported to be a long standing guideline, it&#8217;s clear that reviewers have been exceedingly lax in enforcing it. Theme authors who were ignorant of this guideline will be in for a rude awakening on their next submission for an update. Bennett <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24907\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> in the ticket open on Zerif Lite that the policy will be strongly enforced in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has recently come to our attention that possibly several themes have been approved that may have similar issues. We&#8217;ll address them as we find them, and work with the developers to come up with a plan to bring the themes back into conformance with the requirements &#8211; just as we&#8217;ll do here with your theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This will mean a considerable amount of work for authors who have defined ways for users to generate content through the theme. They will need to port this functionality into a plugin(s).</p>\n<p>WordPress.org themes are not permitted to bundle plugins, but authors can recommend plugins using the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/tgm-plugin-activation-library-publishes-roadmap-for-version-3-0\" target=\"_blank\">TGM Plugin Activation Library</a> or another method. Themes are only permitted to recommend plugins that are listed in the official WordPress.org plugin directory. This means that authors who remove functionality in favor of companion plugins will need to get those plugins approved for WordPress.org before submitting their themes for updates.</p>\n<p>Next week&#8217;s Theme Review Team meeting will include a discussion on specific examples of types of content that themes should or should not be allowed to create, i.e. button text, copyright text, etc. The team is generally in favor of authors using core methods for content creation.</p>\n<p>Documentation regarding this issue has been unclear, incomplete, and scattered, spread across the Codex, Make/Themes, and two different places in the Theme Handbook. The team is working to rectify this in light of its renewed dedication to systematically enforce the &#8220;no content creation&#8221; guideline.</p>\n<p>This will affect many of the top themes hosted on WordPress.org, which will be forced to implement changes that are likely to break thousands of sites&#8217; appearance on update. <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/do-wordpress-org-themes-need-a-changelog\" target=\"_blank\">Without a change log</a> in place, many users will not be aware when they are receiving an update that suddenly requires the installation of new plugins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 May 2015 21:31:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt: Why Awe?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45102\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/why-awe/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:436:\"<blockquote><p>In the great balancing act of our social lives, between the gratification of self-interest and a concern for others, fleeting experiences of awe redefine the self in terms of the collective, and orient our actions toward the needs of those around us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The New York Times answers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/why-do-we-experience-awe.html\">Why Do We Experience Awe?</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 May 2015 16:48:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: My Struggle to Learn How the WordPress REST API Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44319\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wptavern.com/my-struggle-to-learn-how-the-wordpress-rest-api-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3087:\"<p>Earlier today, I watched a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/learn-how-to-utilize-the-wp-rest-api-with-rachel-baker\">free presentation</a> on how to use the WordPress REST API by Rachael Baker via <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com\">WPSessions</a>. If you missed it, you can <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\">watch the recording</a> for $9.</p>\n<p>As I watched the presentation, it was clear that no matter how many tutorials I read, WordCamp sessions I attend, and videos I watch, I won&#8217;t be able to grasp the API until I use products built with it. I&#8217;m not a developer and the REST API is developer centric technology.</p>\n<h2>What I Think the REST API Is</h2>\n<p>Based on what I&#8217;ve learned so far, I&#8217;ve figured out that the API provides a series of end points which are specific parts of WordPress. These end points can be connected to and manipulated through the REST API.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this API that opens up a slew of new opportunities for application developers to send and receive data. This is what allows a developer to build an app that connects to WordPress with minimal code.</p>\n<h2>Learning Custom Post Types</h2>\n<p>In 2010, there <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/styling-individual-pagesposts\">were a lot of requests</a> for <a href=\"http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/wordpress-2-8-and-the-body_class-function/\">tutorials</a> on how to give specific posts a unique style. When <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types\">Custom Post Types</a> were introduced in WordPress 3.0, I was excited because I thought they would provide the ability to create custom styles for posts.</p>\n<p>Looking back, some of the requests are due to the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes_to_2.7#Post_Classes\">post_class() function</a> added in WordPress 2.7 that provides the ability to use CSS to style a post. It took a few years to rewire my brain to not think of Custom Post Types this way.</p>\n<p>When I described how long it took to figure out Custom Post Types on Twitter, Justin Tadlock responded, that end users should have never been introduced to the term <em>post type</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> End users should\'ve never heard the term \"post type\". We devs did a poor job with that.

Unfortunately, not all users have the motivation to follow through with adding a profile picture. You could use a plugin to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/add-avatar-upload-to-buddypress-registration\" target=\"_blank\">add avatar upload to registration</a>, or even <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-forces-buddypress-users-to-upload-a-profile-photo\" target=\"_blank\">force BuddyPress users to upload a profile photo</a> before accessing other pages. However, this may seem a bit heavy handed for some social networks.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Identicons</a> plugin is one alternative that will bring some color to the members directory without troubling users to upload a profile photo. By default, those who haven&#8217;t uploaded an image will have the mystery man avatar assigned. Too many of these can turn your directories into a sea of grey and white and give the impression that members are not invested in the community. BuddyPress Identicons replaces the mystery man with GitHub-style identicons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buddypress-identicons.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buddypress-identicons.jpg?resize=644%2C404\" alt=\"buddypress-identicons\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44322\" /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress developer <a href=\"http://henrywright.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Wright</a>, the plugin&#8217;s creator, was inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub&#8217;s implementation of identicons</a>, which the social network added in 2013 for users who do not have a Gravatar. The idea is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/donpark/identicon\" target=\"_blank\">Don Park&#8217;s original Java and Canvas implementations</a> for creating unique identicons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/henry-identicon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/henry-identicon.jpg?resize=229%2C163\" alt=\"henry-identicon\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44338\" /></a>BuddyPress Identicons are uniquely generated from a hash of the member&#8217;s username. The implementation will not look exactly how it does on GitHub, as the logic used to generate the identicon is somewhat different. In fact, this plugin allows for a few customizations to better fit your social network. You can set the background to transparent in the BuddyPress settings menu and also adjust the image size by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">defining the constants in your bp-custom.php file</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin is compatible with both WordPress multisite and bbPress. After testing it on a BuddyPress site, I can confirm that it works as advertised. If you&#8217;ve been frustrated by a lack of unique avatars on your social network, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Identicons</a> plugin provides an instant fix. Simply install it from WordPress.org, activate it, and all of your mystery men will be transformed into unique, colorful identicons.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 May 2015 23:04:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Postcard Project Discontinued, iOS and Android Apps Now Open Source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/postcard-project-discontinued-ios-and-android-apps-now-open-source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6094:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/postcard-share.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/postcard-share.jpg?resize=316%2C531\" alt=\"postcard-share\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44291\" /></a>Kyle Newsome, creator of <a href=\"http://www.postcardsocial.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard</a>, announced over the weekend that the project will be discontinued. The free social sharing app for iOS <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/own-your-content-postcard-social-sharing-app-launches-with-wordpress-integration\" target=\"_blank\">launched in February of 2014</a> with the aim to make it easy to share content from your phone to multiple social networks, including your own website.</p>\n<p>Postcard&#8217;s chief selling point was the idea of owning your own content. Instead of posting content directly on Facebook or Twitter, for example, you could set your own website as the “host” network and direct all the traffic there.</p>\n<p>Newsome also built a free WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postcard-social/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> as a companion to the app to allow users to host and archive their data. He intended it to help users make sure their websites didn&#8217;t go stale as they regularly posted short form content to social networks.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the idea did not catch on as Newsome hoped it would and he was unable to keep up with the maintenance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fallen behind on maintenance and, due to some sweeping new policy changes in Facebook&#8217;s platform as of May 2015, the live iOS and Android development versions are broken and it&#8217;s been the final kick in my ass necessary to admit Postcard is unsustainable,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Despite making progress on the Android version last month, he was ultimately unable to get it ready for release on the Android market.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Android version making progress. It is very real. <a href=\"http://t.co/7nYYtnHZpm\">pic.twitter.com/7nYYtnHZpm</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Postcard (@postcardsocial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/postcardsocial/status/458338905772023808\">April 21, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://postcardsocial.net/posts/2015-05-25-post-mortem\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard&#8217;s post mortem</a>, Newsome identified changes to external services and their APIs as one of the primary factors for discontinuing the project.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Postcard was an interesting project for me. It started from a frustration with ever changing policies and lack of standardization in social media and ironically will be shutting down for exactly the same reasons. I really have to say that social media management is a tough thing to tackle for any single developer. It&#8217;s hard enough to depend on code that you didn&#8217;t write yourself and it&#8217;s even harder to depend multiple on APIs. It takes a lot of maintenance just to stand still.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keeping the WordPress plugin updated was also a challenge, and Newsome was discouraged at the prospect of having to rebuild it in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress plugin also got stale as a major update and even a new forthcoming JSON API made the custom work I had done seem like a large investment made in something soon to be obsolete,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he found that the costs of maintaining the app, both financially and in terms of time spent, were unsustainable, as the app only pulled in a total of $750 over the past year. This barely covered the app store licensing fees.</p>\n<h3>Postcard Mobile Apps Now Open Source</h3>\n<p>Newsome has no intention of maintaining or developing the mobile apps or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postcard-social/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress plugin</a> anymore. The apps are now available on GitHub under the MIT license with broken/partial functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iOS:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/bitwit/postcard-ios\" target=\"_blank\">github.com/bitwit/postcard-ios</a></li>\n<li><strong>Android:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/bitwit/postcard-android\" target=\"_blank\">github.com/bitwit/postcard-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the code is available to any developer who wants to take the original Postcard idea and run with it or modify it to suit another purpose.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be that developer who never admits their project is over when it&#8217;s over,&#8221; Newsome said. &#8220;Both myself and my users deserve better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He hoped that Postcard would fundamentally change how people use social networks, but the idea of having your WordPress site as the host network for your social content never really caught on. Since many people do not host and maintain their own websites, the golden feature of this app probably went unused by the majority of those who tried it. The ability to broadcast the same content to multiple networks was likely the more popular feature. In the end, the Postcard iOS app was downloaded just 6,000 times.</p>\n<p>Postcard&#8217;s failure may be an indication that people are still not ready for decentralized social networking, where you host your own data and distribute it to third-party social networks at will. Given that the project was powered by a one-person team (a developer who is otherwise employed), Postcard had little chance of being able to keep pace with the development burden of external networks and their changing APIs.</p>\n<p>Newsome may not have launched it with enough resources, or it may not have been the right approach or the right time. Multiple factors combined ultimately spelled Postcard&#8217;s doom, but if any interested parties have the vision and time to revive it or fork it, Newsome is happy to assist in any small way.

Cover brings blogging minimalism to a new level. After less than a month on WordPress.org, it has already been downloaded more than 2,500 times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"cover\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44244\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cover was created by new WordPress.org theme author <a href=\"http://eichefam.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Eiche</a> and is based on the popular <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores starter theme</a> maintained by Automattic.</p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s simple, single-column design is accented by support for full-width featured images. It was bundled with <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome</a> to allow users to easily add scalable vector icons to any content or social menu. Cover incorporates the lightweight <a href=\"https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js\" target=\"_blank\">Headroom.js</a> script for hiding your header until it&#8217;s needed. It also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr\" target=\"_blank\">skrollr.js</a>, a stand-alone parallax scrolling library for mobile (Android + iOS) and desktop.</p>\n<p>Cover&#8217;s widgets and menus are optional and hidden behind an full-screen overlay triggered by the hamburger icon. This keeps the focus on your content while offering plenty of space for unlimited widgets in the overlay.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover-overlay.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover-overlay.jpg?resize=965%2C669\" alt=\"Cover\'s overlay for widgets and menus\" class=\"size-full wp-image-44265\" /></a>Cover&#8217;s overlay for widgets and menus\n<p>Cover supports one regular navigation menu, one for social media, and an additional social menu in the footer. If you&#8217;re using Jetpack’s Infinite Scrolling module, the theme will actually detect whether or not the footer social menu is present and respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>The theme was built to make a nice accompaniment to sites using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Story Engine</a> plugin, although it&#8217;s not required. When used with the plugin, content can expand to full-width when using components such as images, galleries, maps, etc.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer wanting to modify the theme, you&#8217;ll find that Cover&#8217;s stylesheet is compressed. It was built with Sass and the /sass directory includes all the necessary components for compiling the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Cover is a beautifully responsive theme that presents your website in a bold way on any device. Its minimalist design supports your content instead of upstaging it with the clutter of widgets and navigation. Check out a <a href=\"http://eichefam.net/projects/cover/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s project page to see it in action. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/cover/\" target=\"_blank\">Cover</a> is available for free on WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 May 2015 23:15:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: Hello Security Plugin Aims to Educate WordPress Users on Web Security Best Practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"http://wptavern.com/hello-security-plugin-aims-to-educate-wordpress-users-on-web-security-best-practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4532:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-security/\">Hello Security</a> is a new plugin developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_butcher/\">Michele Butcher</a> that displays security tips and reminders in the WordPress backend.

A full list of the tips used is located <a href=\"https://github.com/mlbanddrb/hello-security/blob/master/hello-security.php\">within the hello-security.php file</a>.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration, Motivation, and Determination</h2>\n<p>For years, Butcher has avoided learning how to code. Thanks to a WordCamp session and inspirational members of the WordPress community, she now has a plugin of her own. In this short interview, we find out what held her back from developing plugins sooner and who inspired her to go through the process.</p>\n<p><strong>What held you back from writing your first plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t want to learn how to code. I was a firm believer in that there&#8217;s a plugin for everything. Once I was motivated enough to create one, I didn&#8217;t know what to create first.</p>\n<p>I have ideas for the types of plugins I want to make but I always find three plugins with similar functionality. The first WordPress plugin I&#8217;ve ever looked at the code for is Better WP Security, developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chriswiegman/\">Chris Wiegman</a> that eventually turned into iThemes Security.</p>\n<p>I knew I would have to dig deep into learning code before I could write a plugin that large. I discovered the best way to learn code is to jump in and read actively developed code. Once I became comfortable reading code, I started to get ideas on plugins to create.</p>\n<p><strong>What motivated you enough to go through with creating and releasing your first plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>I subconsciously kept telling myself to <em>just make something</em>. I eventually decided to get into plugin development and taking the first step was the hardest. I bounced ideas off of friends for a long time before I jumped in and just made one.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp North Canton, I attended <a href=\"https://northcanton.wordcamp.org/2015/session/introduction-to-plugin-development/\">Topher DeRosia&#8217;s session, </a>Introduction to WordPress Plugin Development. After the session was over, I realized I didn&#8217;t have to make something that has thousands of lines of code. I brainstormed ideas, thinking how I could use Hello Dolly.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to write Hello Security?</strong></p>\n<p>The first idea that came to mind in using Hello Dolly was not security related. I initially thought of doing something fun like Hello Jovi (Bon Jovi lyrics) or Hello Marvel where I use awesome one liners from the various Marvel movies. Iron Man quotes alone would have given me at least 30 lines to work with.</p>\n<p>I decided against doing something fun and make something that could be useful. Many of the quotes in Hello Security are things I say at all of my talks, tell every client after I clean their site, and mention to everyone who is getting into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Hello Security is there to help those who are either new to WordPress or might not know how or why they should keep their site secure. It is a way to be proactive before something bad happens.

The resource includes each company&#8217;s business model, description, and monthly/yearly revenue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordpress-business-revenue.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordpress-business-revenue.png?resize=1025%2C921\" alt=\"wordpress-business-revenue\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44219\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bolinger is planning to use this information in an upcoming presentation and will be keeping the resource up to date with new submissions and figures as they roll in.</p>\n<p>Transparency reports from WordPress businesses, ranging from small to large, have been popping up frequently over the past year, as owners are surprisingly eager to share their progress and receive feedback from the community. These kinds of reports are not unique to the WordPress ecosystem, but they do seem to complement the spirit of adventure that is common among open source product developers.</p>\n<p>Zack Katz, co-founder of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/gravityview-is-now-public-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">GravityView</a>, remarked on his motivation to share the company&#8217;s revenue publicly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think sharing revenue humanizes GravityView: we&#8217;re not a nameless corporation where you put in money and somehow good products and customer service come out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our customers are part of an interaction: their purchase of a support license directly allows us to develop the product and help them do great things with their websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Katz hopes that the resource will be inspirational for WordPress entrepreneurs who are just getting started.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WordPress community is slowly realizing that businesses don&#8217;t have to be cutthroat black boxes to succeed. As more people and businesses share and open up, we&#8217;re redefining what it means to be a business in the WordPress ecosystem. I think this leads to lower barriers to entry for others to participate. By sharing GravityView&#8217;s numbers and some of the things I&#8217;ve learned, I hope others are better informed and inspired to join our community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, is currently in the midst of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github\" target=\"_blank\"> active experimentation with his products and business model</a> and recently published a <a href=\"http://aesopinteractive.com/jan-april-2015-report/\" target=\"_blank\">transparency report</a> for his 15-month old company. He believes that these kinds of reports are important for demonstrating the types of products and pricing models that can be successful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think for Aesopinteractive it&#8217;s showing that you can still abide by WordPress theme best practices, and be successful at selling WordPress themes as add-ons at $129 each with 3-5 options and no functionality,&#8221; Haskins said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plus, I really hope it motivates other &#8216;small timers&#8217; to share numbers as well, and be held accountable for our growth. It&#8217;s a lot like sharing your goals publicly, and letting people hold you accountable for it.

He initially wrote the parser/indexer for his own use, to improve efficiency in his work, and was inspired to make it a public resource.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been professionally working with WordPress since 2.8, but most of which I would describe as &#8216;superficial development,\'&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until later, roughly WordPress 3.5, that a large-scale WordPress project came along.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I found myself spending an obscene amount of time either digging through code within my IDE, or performing countless Google searches, in order to uncover/understand various hooks, functions, constants etc. So, I wrote a plugin that would index the application/site it was installed within&#8211; this was the first iteration of Hookr.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a developer whose career is not based in the WordPress ecosystem, Sanford didn&#8217;t know what to expect when he tested the waters with his new public resource for developers. After several months in alpha, the traffic and feedback were enough to convince him to invest in performance improvements and an overhaul of the UI.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alpha version of the site was truly alpha &#8211; the UI was a complete afterthought, there were many UI bugs/hiccups, the navigation was not cohesive; it was a hot mess,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Prior to the beta, I had not updated hookr.io for months, which was purposeful. I wanted to see if the traffic would completely level-off, or if it would remain consistent, with the latter being the determining factor as to whether or not I would continue with the project.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Hookr Beta Adds UI/UX Improvements and Support for 800+ Plugins and Themes</h2>\n<p>Sanford was surprised and encouraged to find that usage of the site was solid and continued to grow. He spent the next three months fixing issues, rewriting core parts of the parser, and refining the UI to focus on features that people actually needed. The site has now entered beta with a slew of noteworthy improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX overhaul, with emphasis on responsiveness and fewest number of clicks</li>\n<li>Hookr.io is now twice as fast with half the download payload (mobile first)</li>\n<li>Themes have been introduced to the index &#8211; (current count: 62)</li>\n<li>Hundreds of plugins added to the index (current count: 827)</li>\n<li>5 of the latest versions of each plugin and theme (previously included a single version for each plugin)</li>\n<li>Usage examples that users can cut and paste</li>\n<li>Annotated source code</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://hookr.io/all/#index=a\" target=\"_blank\">Index screens</a> are infinitely-scrollable and filterable, which cuts down on a lot of clicking through endless pagination. <a href=\"http://hookr.io/4.1.1/filters/get_search_form/\" target=\"_blank\">Hook details</a> have been refined to follow a format similar to PHP&#8217;s detail pages and include annotated code signatures and descriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-annotated-descriptions.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-annotated-descriptions.png?resize=1025%2C701\" alt=\"hookr-annotated-descriptions\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44177\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to the basic info about the file and lines where the code/object is defined, Hookr has also been updated to display any related hook callbacks sharing the same tag name or signature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-relations.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-relations.png?resize=1025%2C701\" alt=\"hookr-relations\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44179\" /></a></p>\n<p>Usage examples for every action, filter, function, and constant can now be easily copied. Users can also quickly view source code with Hookr&#8217;s new hyperlinked and annotated source code blocks.</p>\n<h2>To Rebrand or Not to Rebrand?</h2>\n<p>Many of those in search of a comprehensive hook/API reference find Hookr to be easier to use than the official <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org code reference</a>. Sanford has experienced friction from creating what some perceive to be a competing resource.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were several people that have/had an issue with the resource even existing. For the sake of full-disclosure, my career is outside the WordPress ecosystem; it is simply a platform I use (and love), not a lifestyle. </p>\n<p>My experience with the &#8216;community&#8217; has been mostly positive; many people love the resource, while others are indifferent. I wrote Hookr to aid legit designers/developers/agencies, not hobbyists masquerading as designers/developers who have no skill besides martyrdom and nothing positive to contribute.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Hookr name has also proven to be controversial, as a few vocal opponents find it to be off-putting and offensive. Sanford said that he is very much torn over rebranding the site but is open to the idea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress market is saturated &#8211; it is hard to make any sort of impact, hence the name,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The name is short, controversial, relevant, and memorable &#8211; either people love or hate it, of course. It was never the intent to insult, offend, or alienate any demographic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people are uncomfortable saying &#8220;Hookr&#8221; in an open forum, then maybe it&#8217;s time to put my personal ethos aside for the betterment of the resource. That being said, I am on the fence in regards to renaming/rebranding Hookr. If I do, it&#8217;s only to remove the initial barrier/stigma and promote usage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the site is still in beta, Sanford is still collecting feedback from users but is concentrating on features, fixes, and SEO. If he decides to rebrand, it will likely happen as the site moves out of beta.</p>\n<h2>The Future of the Hookr.io Resource</h2>\n<p>After streamlining the design, removing a few features that no one used, and refining those that worked, Sanford reports that so far users are enjoying the beta version of Hookr.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The feedback I have received has been exceedingly positive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The usage has effectively doubled.&#8221; User suggestions regarding the search functionality are shaping the roadmap for the next iteration of the resource.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current search implementation is more or less a filter mechanism, which is effective once you&#8217;ve drilled-down to the relevant index,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;However, numerous users have asked for a traditional &#8216;global&#8217; keyword search that spans core, plugins, and themes. The global search, along with a few other features, will be released within the next month or so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Sanford is committed to keeping the resource free for anyone to use, he is exploring a few long term options for monetization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cluttering the interface with ads is not something I want to do, but never say never,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, there is another opportunity for monetization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the future, Sanford is looking at the possibility of establishing the infrastructure to offer Hookr (SaaS) for commercial theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I released Hookr Alpha, a few people inquired about using it to augment the documentation of their premium plugin/theme. I wasn&#8217;t confident that it was a true &#8216;value-add.&#8217; Over the course of a year, I&#8217;ve refined the parser and data objects to a point of viability. </p>\n<p>The Hookr Parser analyzes source code, which is then reconciled against the inline documentation describing it; often times, the inline documentation is either missing or is erroneous. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJeffMatson\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Matson</a> and I discussed these issues and decided that Hookr would be invaluable if it could identify these issues, which it now does.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A SaaS model for monetization would allow Sanford to offer developers pre-generated documentation with their themes/plugins. He is also exploring the possibility of offering the raw data in JSON, XML, CSV, etc. to vendors to implement an API microsite.</p>\n<p>For the time being, Sanford will continue investing time into improving Hookr as a reference and refining features according to user feedback.

This was certainly the case at WordCamp London 2015 where more than 200 people crammed into a small room to hear <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jack-lenox-on-building-themes-with-the-wp-rest-api\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Lenox’s presentation on Building Themes with the WP REST API</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rachel-baker.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rachel-baker.jpeg?resize=140%2C140\" alt=\"rachel-baker\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44126\" /></a>If you&#8217;re a developer who is ready to learn more about getting started with the API, you will not want to miss WPSessions&#8217; upcoming free live event. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelbaker\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Baker</a>, lead engineer at <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wirecutter</a> and formerly a senior engineer at <a href=\"http://10up.com/\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, will be presenting on <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Utilizing the WP REST API</a> on Tuesday, May 26, 2015.</p>\n<p>Baker is one of the lead developers on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">WP-API project</a> and is fully in tune with where it&#8217;s headed, as well as all the changes in the latest <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-version-2-0-beta-1-released\" target=\"_blank\">2.0 beta release</a>. The topics she plans to cover will help developers dive in and start extending 2.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The content is driven by wanting to dig deeper with a more technical audience from the overview presentations you see at WordCamps and wanting to show off how easy it is to extend our version 2.0,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;This course is only 30-40 minutes, but if it goes well Brian would like to add more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She plans to cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing the WP REST API</li>\n<li>Consuming core endpoints</li>\n<li>Creating custom endpoints</li>\n<li>Manipulating and Extending API results</li>\n<li>Preparing for future inclusion in WordPress core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;It is targeted at developers who are interested in seeing how they can use and customize the API,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;Front-end and full-stack developers will see how to add additional fields to the existing endpoint responses. Plugin developers will see a demonstration of how to add their own endpoints. If you are interested in using the WP REST API, or have used version 1.x, you will want to see how version 2.0 works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Baker&#8217;s session will essentially be a crash course in getting started, covering all the basics and more. While there has been a great deal of excitement surrounding the API and what it means for the future of WordPress, many developers are still getting a grasp on how they can incorporate it into real world projects. John James Jacoby made an interesting observation in his <a href=\"http://jaco.by/2015/05/14/loopconf/\" target=\"_blank\">recap of LoopConf</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So many mentions of the REST API, but not a lot of truly practical usages yet – everyone is building WordPress minus WordPress instead of replacing existing piecemeal AJAX calls or iteratively improving WordPress itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker is planning to include practical examples in her presentation. One of her main objectives is to help developers get going with the 2.0 beta version so they can offer feedback as they continue to work with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can think of many practical uses, from powering interactions in a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Contact Forms</a> to providing an API for a mobile app like <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/\" target=\"_blank\">StoryCorps.me</a>,&#8221; Baker said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our community is hearing that the WP REST API is going to <em>change WordPress</em> and they haven’t seen that happen. I don’t see the WP REST API as changing WordPress. I see the WP REST API as a WordPress feature that makes it easier to interact with your site’s data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who haven&#8217;t been able to attend a session on the API in person have an excellent opportunity to see <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Baker&#8217;s WPSessions presentation</a> live for free on Tuesday, May 26th at 3pm EST (<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150526T19&p1=1440&ah=1\" target=\"_blank\">UTC-4</a>).

In the following short interview, Hendriksen describes common pain points users experience with WordPress and shares advice for new users.</p>\n<h2>Short Interview with Hendriksen</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-swag.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-17801\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-swag.jpg?resize=1024%2C441\" alt=\"photo credit: Huasonic - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/huasonic/3008912290/\">Huasonic</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p><strong>Which aspects of WordPress do users have the most trouble with?</strong></p>\n<p>Based on course feedback and a myriad of emails and questions on Twitter, the hangups people encounter when using WordPress fall into three main categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installation and migration</li>\n<li>User interface and feature changes</li>\n<li>Theme and plugin inconsistencies</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Installation and Migration</h3>\n<p>More and more users create local installs to experiment before launching their sites, and they&#8217;re creating quite advanced sites on their local computers. When it comes time to migrate these sites, they often get stuck.</p>\n<p>I think this is partially due to lack of official and understandable documentation about migration, and partially because the general level of technical know-how necessary to build a local install is decreasing. Thanks to tools like MAMP/WAMP, BitNami, and ServerPress, more advanced skills like migration and external hosting become bigger steps up than they were previously.</p>\n<h3><strong>User Interface and Feature Changes</strong></h3>\n<p>As WordPress evolves, user interface changes are fairly common but in most cases, they are left unaddressed in release documentation. Recent examples include the removal of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/major-problems-with-image-editing-in-wp-39?replies=12\">Advanced Image Options</a> and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-restore-the-link-title-attribute-removed-in-wordpress-4-2\">Link Title</a> from the editor modals. When changes like these are encountered by existing users, their first response is to assume they are doing something wrong or there is something wrong with their install.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is justifiable: In other software and in most other situations in the physical world, when a feature is removed or altered in such a way it is not easily found, this change is clearly addressed.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, it is usually only the large feature changes that are explained while the smaller ones are left for the user to discover on their own. When these features are part of the user&#8217;s workflow, that becomes a problem. This is further exacerbated when meta-conversations in the advanced community go public providing confusing and often contradictory information for new users.</p>\n<h3><strong>Theme and Plugin Inconsistencies</strong></h3>\n<p>The final grouping is the most obvious one. As the theme and plugin landscape becomes more diversified, users often feel overwhelmed and confused about what solutions to choose and how to use them. A search for membership plugins, business themes, or booking calendars returns hundreds if not thousands of widely different solutions that often have little in common.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can find blog posts and lists claiming that pretty much every one of them is the best one and the rest are inferior copies. On top of that, more and more themes and plugins are released as freemium offerings or shells that lead the user to a third-party service.</p>\n<p>All of this comes together to produce a confusing and frustrating user experience that leaves many users feeling like they are not smart enough to use the application or that they made a wrong choice in going with WordPress.</p>\n<p>These are all issues that could be resolved by creating consistent user experiences and by theme and plugin developer communities becoming more mindful of what kind of experiences they provide for the user when they ship freemium solutions or third-party up-sells.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressRoadBlocks.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44073\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressRoadBlocks.png?resize=650%2C200\" alt=\"WordPress Road Blocks\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23559988@N05/2931537231\">Haven bridge road block</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><strong>Are there more roadblocks to overcome than there were five years ago?</strong></p>\n<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. WordPress has more roadblocks for the beginner, but for the more experienced user there are also more opportunities. I think one of the major challenges we are facing as a community is that WordPress is becoming too advanced for its core user base. The appeal of click-and-publish services like WIX and SquareSpace is that they do not require an in-depth understanding of the underpinnings of the application for it to work.</p>\n<p>In striving to become a full-fledged CMS for advanced developers and large publications, <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">WordPress has let itself drift away from its core philosophy of democratizing publishing by adding the very level of complexity it originally aimed to remove.</span> Combined with the theme and plugin issues described above and a lack of modern tools that users expect such as, drag-and-drop design tools and front-end editing, I see new users respond the same way to WordPress today that they did to Drupal five years ago.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, these roadblocks are more like speed bumps than fortified walls. With patience and access to well-crafted and easy to understand training materials, I stand by my claim that anyone, regardless of previous experience, can learn to build a great website with WordPress. What has changed is the level of complexity, both in use and in what you can produce.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressAdviceForNewUsers.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44085\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressAdviceForNewUsers.png?resize=612%2C237\" alt=\"WordPress Advice For New Users\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/99329675@N02/11064947983\">What You Need To Know About Food Poisoning</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for those new to WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>My number one piece of advice for new and existing WordPress users is to always remember that WordPress is just a tool that makes it easy for you to put content in a database and your visitors to retrieve that content. When learning a new tool as technically advanced as WordPress, it is easy to get so caught up in the tool itself, that you forget what you wanted to do in the first place. Whatever your goals and intentions were when you picked up WordPress for the first time, make sure you remember them and keep working toward them.</p>\n<p>When learning WordPress, whether you are teaching yourself, learning from books or videos, or going to class, remember that every person in the community, even <a href=\"http://nacin.com/\">Andrew Nacin</a>, was at some point in time where you are now: <strong>Just trying to figure it all out</strong>. While every person&#8217;s path to learning is different, they all have one thing in common: <strong>They all learn from each other.</strong></p>\n<p>So reach out online, in person, through Twitter, Facebook groups, Meetups, WordCamps, and beyond, and find like-minded people who want to learn with you or help you on your way. When you meet someone who is just starting out, help them get their footing and invite them into the community.</p>\n<p>Finally, remember that WordPress is not an island. The web community is a rich ecosystem with many differing solutions based on the same core technology. Learning how the web works gives you the power to use WordPress to move beyond its borders and it&#8217;s beyond those borders where true magic is found.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 May 2015 19:21:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org is Testing International Theme and Plugin Directories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-is-testing-international-theme-and-plugin-directories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3751:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flags.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flags.jpg?resize=1020%2C500\" alt=\"flags\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16697\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org is making strides towards fully localizing the project&#8217;s official theme and plugin directories. Dion Hulse <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2015/05/20/hi-everyone-as-some-of-you-are-aware/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> this morning that he has enabled localized theme directories for all Rosetta sites. For example, the Romanian themes directory is available at: <a href=\"https://ro.wordpress.org/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">ro.wordpress.org/themes/</a>.</p>\n<p>Theme filters, directory sub-navigation, info and download buttons, and other aspects of the details page are all translated. Description and titles are not yet translated, but Hulse says the plan is to add those in the near future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-themes.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-themes.png?resize=1025%2C677\" alt=\"romanian-themes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44080\" /></a></p>\n<p>Those who are interested in helping translate the interface for the localized theme directories are encouraged to visit the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/themes\" target=\"_blank\">meta translation project page</a>. The process for contributing is the same that is used with WordPress&#8217; other Rosetta translations.</p>\n<p>Localized plugin directories are being actively tested at /plugins/ and the sites are also <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/plugins\" target=\"_blank\">available for contributions from translators</a>. Check out <a href=\"https://ro.wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">ro.wordpress.org/plugins/</a> to see the Romanian plugin directory as an example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-plugins.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-plugins.png?resize=1025%2C685\" alt=\"romanian-plugins\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44079\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the localized theme and plugin directories are new, there are still a few missing pieces and likely a good number of bugs that will need to be resolved. You can help by reporting them on Hulse&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2015/05/20/hi-everyone-as-some-of-you-are-aware/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on the make.wordperss.org/polyglots blog or by opening a ticket on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=Theme%20Directory\" target=\"_blank\">meta.trac</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-state-of-the-word-highlights-internationalization-mobile-and-new-tools-for-wordpress-contributors\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s 2014 State of the Word address</a>, he highlighted the importance of internationalization improvements for connecting and growing the global WordPress community. Localized directories for plugins and themes on WordPress.org are part of this larger effort and make the project&#8217;s website easier to navigate for non-English speaking users.</p>\n<p>In the future, translation of WordPress&#8217; development handbooks, the codex, and other documentation could also play a large part towards inspiring international developers to make more extensions, products for the marketplace, and contributions back to the project.

It quickly became popular and paved the way for hundreds of shops to follow in their footsteps.</p>\n<p>With the leadership of Adii Pienaar and co-founders Mark Forrester and Magnus Jepson, WooThemes did a ton of interesting things over the years, and dominated the market with a handful of other shops. They <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2011/09/woocommerce-has-arrived/\">launched WooCommerce in September 2011</a>, in the middle of the commercial theme heyday.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s origins are a hot mess and a long story. WooThemes worked for a long time to develop, with partners, their own eCommerce solution. After numerous failed attempts and false starts, they hired <a href=\"http://mikejolley.com/\">Mike Jolley</a> and <a href=\"http://jameskoster.co.uk/\">Jay Koster</a> full time, and forked JigoShop after acquisition negotiations broke down. Jigoshop is a product that Mike and Jay built as freelancers for JigoWatt, but has since been sold off to another consulting company.</p>\n<p>Mike and Jay were, and are, the heart of that eCommerce plugin &#8212; the one we know today as WooCommerce. Under their stewardship, and dozens of other full time and part time contributors &#8212; mixed in with outstanding marketing, perfect timing, and a lack of modern competition &#8212; WooCommerce took the WordPress world by storm.</p>\n<p>They pioneered the extension model for paid add-ons. They put all doubters to rest over and over again. They made mistakes. But they kept at it, kept working, kept making it better. And soon enough, they took the eCommerce world by storm too.</p>\n<p>In a short period of four years, WooCommerce has gone from a struggling concept, to a fork, to a remarkable open source commercial software success story.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of following WooThemes since around the time they started, and have gotten to know the project and their team even more closely since the very early days of WooCommerce&#8217;s launch. In this post, I bring my analysis of the company based on those years of my watching them grow and interacting with them, and hope to share what the acquisition by Automattic may mean for the future.</p>\n<h3>Why WooCommerce is attractive</h3>\n<p>On the surface, it may seem to many that Automattic was the obvious choice to acquire WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>After all, they need eCommerce support for <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a>. As Matt Mullenweg shared with me, they, &#8220;have a ton of demand,&#8221; for eCommerce from WordPress.com users. Acquiring WooCommerce gives Automattic access to the largest single group of eCommerce stores in the world.</p>\n<h4>One of many options</h4>\n<p>But Mark Forrester and Magnus Jepson &#8212; co-founders and owners of WooThemes &#8212; could have gone many other routes.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is big enough, and has enough brand power, to have attracted significant venture capital investments, as well as suitors from well outside the WordPress space &#8212; suitors like MasterCard, eBay/Paypal, Amazon, or Yahoo.</p>\n<p>There are 1.2+ million active installs of WooCommerce. They have a nearly <a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\">20% eCommerce marketshare</a> of the top one million websites, and over 24% eCommerce marketshare of all websites.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12685\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/woocommerce-builtwith-top-million.png\" alt=\"woocommerce-builtwith-top-million\" width=\"631\" height=\"499\" /></p>\n<p>The plugin has had rapid growth over its short four year existence, making it a ripe target for the right buyer.</p>\n<h4>A natural fit</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s popularity has largely been due to the fact that it&#8217;s available on WordPress. WordPress makes WooCommerce an attractive choice for websites that need bolt-on eCommerce.</p>\n<p>One of WooCommerce&#8217;s greatest opportunities for growth is for customers that are eCommerce first, other-parts-of-the-website second. It&#8217;s gaining ground quickly as both WooCommerce and WordPress gain further respect for usage on websites of all sizes and scopes.</p>\n<p>All of these factors make WooCommerce an attractive choice for Automattic. Automattic&#8217;s team knows, understands, and contributes greatly to the WordPress project. A shared reliance on WordPress core makes a WooCommerce and WordPress.com integration simpler. And 55 talented, eCommerce focused employees makes for an inviting addition to Automattic&#8217;s relatively small workforce.</p>\n<h3>18% growth in Automattic employees</h3>\n<p>Bringing 55 new people on at once swells Automattic&#8217;s ranks by around 18%, bringing them to over 360 people. Recruiting is not easy. This gain of talented people, in a single fell swoop, should not be underestimated.</p>\n<p>But there may be some challenges integrating the two teams. This is, by far, the most people brought under the Automattic umbrella in a single acquisition.</p>\n<h4>Team integration</h4>\n<p>WooThemes&#8217; theme division and team members will join Automattic&#8217;s theme team, and it&#8217;s my understanding that WooThemes support will join the Happiness team at Automattic as well.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has long battled a significant support burden, even before WooCommerce came along. With the demands of supporting eCommerce software that can conflict with nearly infinite plugins, themes, and hosting environments makes support expensive. As long as WooCommerce offers paid self-hosted products, this support will need to be managed.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will certainly benefit from the developer resources at Automattic. Matt told me, &#8220;lots of folks at Automattic [are] interested in working on eCommerce.&#8221; From code audits, to fresh eyes, to more seasoned developers, Automattic&#8217;s team will be able to have an immediate impact on the WooCommerce product line.</p>\n<h4>Merging management</h4>\n<p>One aspect I don&#8217;t know much about yet is in regard to WooThemes&#8217; middle management. Mark and Magnus own the company, but there is a four person leadership team beyond them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joel Bronkowski, Chief Business Development Officer</li>\n<li>Warren Holmes, Chief Marketing Officer</li>\n<li>Matty Cohen, Chief Product Officer</li>\n<li>Michael Krapf, Chief Happiness Officer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, there are product leads for WooCommerce, Sensei, themes, and other elements of WooThemes&#8217; business. As a company, WooThemes is probably as hierarchical as Automattic with six times fewer people.</p>\n<p>I anticipate some managers may merge into other Automattic teams under new roles, or play a part in sub-teams of sorts, which is (I believe) how Jetpack works now that it&#8217;s such a big team.</p>\n<h4>Already distributed</h4>\n<p>WooThemes is already distributed across five continents and perfectly accustomed to remote work. While they have an office (WooHQ) in Cape Town, South Africa, it&#8217;s a &#8220;come as you please&#8221; environment, similar to Automattic&#8217;s San Francisco space.</p>\n<p>Joining Automattic will be a much cleaner culture fit than other potential buyers would have been. Some team members will naturally leave or integrate to other roles, but the overall gain is a huge win for both organizations.</p>\n<h3>The likely end of &#8220;WooThemes&#8221; as a name</h3>\n<p>WooThemes is a staple brand of the WordPress ecosystem. They&#8217;ve been around since 2008 and probably have the biggest single brand presence after WordPress itself; I&#8217;d argue the name is more well-known than Automattic, or even perhaps ThemeForest.</p>\n<p>For all practical purposes, I believe the name WooThemes will be retired.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has previously considered a name change to reflect the change in their business focus, but have not done it. Under the umbrella of Automattic and WordPress.com, there is really no need to carry on the WooThemes brand.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m told the decision to change the name of the website hasn&#8217;t been officially made yet, but it makes no sense to me to keep WooThemes. I&#8217;d expect the website we see at WooThemes.com to before long be simply <a href=\"http://woocommerce.com\">WooCommerce.com</a>.</p>\n<p>They better keep Hiro, the Woo Ninja though. I love that little guy.</p>\n<h3>The WooCommerce business model</h3>\n<p>The WooCommerce business model is built largely on paid extensions that offer additional eCommerce functionality, updates, and support.</p>\n<h4>The current extension model</h4>\n<p>WooThemes lists a whopping 346 paid and free extensions on their website, about 150 of which link to third party sites. The remaining 200 or so extensions are either developed in house or in partnership with third party developers, but sold on WooThemes&#8217; website. There are also dozens, if not hundreds more, distributed plugins by other vendors that are not listed.</p>\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.skyverge.com/\">SkyVerge</a> and <a href=\"http://prospress.com/\">Prospress</a> have built their businesses on WooCommerce extension development. If the model were to change drastically, it could have a great deal of impact on them and similar companies or solo developers.</p>\n<p>Third party developers have been told that life will be business as usual. In an email to strategic partners, Joel Bronkowski said, &#8220;There are no plans to mess with the magic sauce strategy that has brought us this far.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>A conflict of ideology</h4>\n<p>However, the model of paid plugins is also counter to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s often stated beliefs for what commercialization in the WordPress plugin space should look like.</p>\n<p>I asked him to explain how his mindset has changed in regard to paid plugins that charge for support and updates. Paid Automattic plugins, like Akismet and VaultPress, are based on SaaS models.</p>\n<p>He says that his view has not changed. He told me that one goal with WooCommerce will be to determine, &#8220;what services provide the most value to people over a long period of time.&#8221; He also noted that such a question is due to the fact that many WordPress product sales are one-time.</p>\n<p>I found his sentiment curious. He didn&#8217;t directly answer the question about paid plugins, which isn&#8217;t too surprising. It&#8217;s impossible to imagine Automattic doing away with paid extensions in the short term, but there are serious threats to third party developers in the longer term, I believe.</p>\n<h4>Expansion of partnerships with larger corporations</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce has spent a lot of time doing business development over the last couple of years. Last summer, their leadership team <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2014/07/woocommerce-journey-irce-2014/\">went to Chicago</a> for a big eCommerce conference and had a whole new world opened up to them.</p>\n<p>Joel told me they, &#8220;still have a lot to figure out in terms of the road ahead, but [we are] incredibly excited about what this means for us in terms of product development, partner opportunities and for WordPress powered eCommerce.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Under the wing of Automattic and in the future WordPress.com, I think WooCommerce will be able to further leverage their position in the eCommerce market with big payment companies and other potential corporate entities.</p>\n<h4>Potential changes to the business model</h4>\n<p>I would guess that a gradual change in business model will occur over the next several years, especially in regard to extensions. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">WooCommerce has a dismal 17% renewal rate for extension purchases.</span> This is a number that needs to improve, or something should change.</p>\n<p>It may make sense &#8212; and I&#8217;m shocked I&#8217;m saying it &#8212; to make WooCommerce more like Jetpack.</p>\n<p>If I were at Automattic, I would encourage the two teams to brainstorm and evolve together. I think a model where a credit card is connected to WordPress.com, and extensions (free and paid) can be easily activated from within the admin makes sense. It would require a lot of change to existing UIs and development infrastructure, but it could also drastically improve what is often a convoluted method for site management with so many add-ons being independently managed.</p>\n<p>If we take the potential even further: imagine the VaultPress model of instant syncing, data tracking, and backups being heavily integrated into eCommerce stores. Such a system could be part of a monthly fee.</p>\n<p>Extensions also don&#8217;t have to be piecemeal, or the &#8220;nickel and dime&#8221; method. Automattic could make WooCommerce a tiered payment plan, where certain levels unlock particular functionality. Or they could buyout all third party paid extensions they care about and make the entire product free or part of a single package.</p>\n<p>The point is that Automattic purchasing WooCommerce gives them an incredible amount of flexibility in terms of how to move forward. WooCommerce store owners should be prepared for a lot of potential change.</p>\n<p>As a bootstrapped company, WooThemes had to turn a profit. Automattic has to make the company more valuable, but does not need to care about cash day to day. Their stated goal is to make products people want to use. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">A very small number of people at Automattic really consider profits and losses regularly. That mindset, when applied to WooCommerce, could bring about significant change indeed.</span></p>\n<h4>Bringing WooCommerce to WordPress.com</h4>\n<p>An important concern over the next year or two will be how to bring WooCommerce to WordPress.com. There is little question that it will happen.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg highlighted the demand from the general WordPress.com userbase, and hosted WooCommerce would be a great answer to Squarespace&#8217;s eCommerce add-on, and the likes of Shopify and BigCartel.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I&#8217;m sure a number of WordPress.com VIP customers will be clamoring for WooCommerce. Automattic&#8217;s Vice President of Platform Services, Paul Maiorana, said, &#8220;VIP tends to follow the same trends as the broader WP community. Initially blogs, then CMS, now everything.&#8221; He is excited about being able to offer a more catered eCommerce experience &#8220;in house to better service those customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A hosted version of WooCommerce will be a very compelling upsell for WordPress.com if they are able to pull it off well. This too, will not be easy. But they are starting with a heck of a head start, given the WooCommerce brand name, team, and existing plugin infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>What the acquisition means for other WooThemes products</h3>\n<p>WooThemes makes more than WooCommerce, however nearly all of their products today at least integrate with WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>WooThemes&#8217; themes will be integrated into WordPress.com&#8217;s theme offering. Eleven themes are <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=woothemes\">already listed there</a> from an existing partnership that goes back to early 2011.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/\">Sensei courseware plugin</a> will also continue to be developed and maintained. Regarding Sensei, Matt Mullenweg said, &#8220;their team is passionate about it, which is kind of the criteria for what Automattic works on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is a lot of potential in the course space, and I actually think this could be a nice win for Automattic in this acquisition, especially if Sensei gets additional resources and attention.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has other active free plugins that I doubt will change much. WooSlider is their only other paid plugin, but I don&#8217;t think it makes up a considerable amount of revenue.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if both WooSlider and Sensei core become free plugins.</p>\n<h3>WooThemes&#8217; revenue and the acquisition price</h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to know: how much was WooThemes making, and how much was the acquisition for?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/19/wordpress-parent-automattic-buys-woocommerce-a-shopping-tool-for-web-publishers/\">Re/code&#8217;s Peter Kafka</a> has sources that say the acquisition was for, &#8220;more than $30 million in cash and stock.&#8221; I believe this to be a reasonable amount and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d make the claim without some confidence.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what the terms of the deal were. I&#8217;ve tried all day to find out. The best I can do is tell you what I know, what I think I know, and guess right along with everyone else. Sounds fun, right?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite confident that WooThemes&#8217; revenues were around $9-$10 million in 2013. I also know that they have had positive trajectory month over month growth for some time, and I have reason to believe one of their more recent record months well exceeded $1 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>If we extrapolate the 2013 numbers with 10-20% growth, we can presume that their gross revenues are somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million annually.</p>\n<p>Based on some feedback from people I trust, a 2x multiple of expected 2015 revenues isn&#8217;t out of the question. In typical proprietary software and product situations, that would be a low multiplier.</p>\n<p>But in this case, WooThemes&#8217; sends a lot of money directly to third party developers, and spends a great deal of money on development and support. Furthermore, WooCommerce isn&#8217;t proprietary, it&#8217;s open source; which while I love and advocate for it, it simply would be difficult to valuate the same as proprietary software.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I could be naive, but in the case of Automattic I&#8217;d rather more stock than cash. They are destined for an IPO (someday) that will likely put them well beyond their latest <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/\">$1.16 billion valuation</a>, and today&#8217;s stock could be worth many times what it is now in the years to come.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I don&#8217;t think Re/code would run a number they pulled out of thin air. I think they got that from somewhere &#8212; perhaps a VC source.</p>\n<h3>Good for both sides, but not without consequences</h3>\n<p>I firmly believe WooThemes could&#8217;ve continued to grow WooCommerce to be worth $100 million or more. But it would&#8217;ve likely been a long and challenging road.</p>\n<p>Under the Automattic umbrella, they have a great shot to continue making an awesome eCommerce product without some of their current burdens and with some outstanding new resources.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, especially if the $30-$35 million price is correct, I think Automattic got a steal. It&#8217;s a brilliant way into a huge market with a major player.</p>\n<p>There are potential downsides to this purchase. For one, it makes Automattic further feel like a vacuum that inevitably sucks up the best talent, agencies, and products once they showcase their potential for success.</p>\n<p>WooThemes was the bastion all other bootstrapped WordPress products stood behind. Knowing it&#8217;s possible to do something as big as WooThemes was doing, without funding and starting from nothing, is awesome.</p>\n<p>Seeing them snatched up by Automattic around the time they&#8217;ve become nearly ubiquitous with the term &#8220;WordPress eCommerce&#8221; is kind of a bummer. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">It&#8217;s like we now have to start over again to see what WordPress centric product company can grow big enough to stand beside Automattic, not under it.</span></p>\n<p>I also have some fear that if Automattic rocks the boat too much with WooCommerce it will cause some big inroads WordPress has made in self-hosted eCommerce to be lost.</p>\n<p>My concerns are relatively minor. Would I have loved to see WooThemes continue to grow and dominate eCommerce alone? Yes. Am I excited by what this deal makes possible? Yes. Am I a little concerned what it will do to the WordPress economy? Yes.</p>\n<p>We must all weigh the pros and cons of any decision. For Mark, Magnus, and the WooThemes team, this is a move that is good for them during this time, and will likely be good for the company they started seven years ago.</p>\n<p>For Automattic, this is a heck of a way to round out their first decade in business. It&#8217;ll be really interesting to see what the next decade holds in store, but I bet Automattic will look a lot different then, like they do now compared to 2005.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to both teams.

The <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> recently passed seven million downloads and stats from BuiltWith show that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce is dominating global e-commerce platforms</a>, powering roughly 30% of all online stores.</p>\n<p>This is Automattic&#8217;s largest acquisition to date, bringing 55 new employees into the company from 16 countries for a total of 370 Automatticians. Mullenweg confirmed that the acquisition includes <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Woo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/\" target=\"_blank\">Sensei</a>, and all of the other plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>Given WooCommerce&#8217;s extensive adoption on the web, Automattic will not be re-branding the newly acquired products. WooThemes and WooCommerce will continue to be sold via their dedicated websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re planning on retaining (and growing) the WooCommerce brand,&#8221; Mullenweg told the Tavern. &#8220;The plan is to keep what has been working going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has spoken frequently over the years about growing Automattic&#8217;s reach into global commerce, but few could have predicted that the company would acquire Woo as opposed to building its own in-house commerce platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They have a full team that goes to bed every night and wakes up in the morning thinking about commerce; it’s core to their DNA,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That’s better than starting it in-house. Also they have a ton of adoption already.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In April, WooThemes co-founder Magnus Jepson told the Tavern that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce accounts for over 85% of overall sales</a> and processes &#8220;several million dollars per year.” Jepson also confirmed that WooCommerce&#8217;s revenue &#8220;has been climbing steadily over the past few years, and we are regularly breaking monthly revenue records.”</p>\n<p>Automattic is not releasing the financial details of the acquisition, but <a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/19/wordpress-parent-automattic-buys-woocommerce-a-shopping-tool-for-web-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">Re/code speculates</a> that it was in the range of $30 million:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sources say Automattic will spend more than $30 million in cash and stock to buy the 55-person company. Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg wouldn’t comment on the price but said the acquisition was the largest his company had made, &#8216;by about 6x.&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to growing the current WooCommerce customer base, Automattic is looking to use the platform to add more selling options for WordPress.com customers, while retaining its existing e-commerce partnerships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Partnerships will remain in place on WP.com, but long-term we’d like to offer Woo as an option there as well,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>When asked about plans to integrate WooCommerce into Jetpack, he said, &#8220;Jetpack could definitely complement WooCommerce (and WooThemes), but not the other way around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooThemes founders never imagined that WooCommerce would rise to the level of popularity that it has, ultimately bringing them into the Automattic family. Co-founder Mark Forrester <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/05/woothemes-joins-automattic/\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2008, as three strangers in three countries, we set out on a quest to pioneer WordPress commercial theming, never dreaming of the rocket-propelled voyage into the self-hosted eCommerce unknown that lay ahead. It’s been an incredible ride, backed by a unique community, and here we find ourselves powering over 24% of online stores with our flagship product, WooCommerce.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The acquisition affects a whole fleet of third-party designers and developers who create products for WooCommerce. They will likely have more opportunities and sales ahead of them with the power of Automattic behind the core plugin. Mullenweg confirmed that the next WooConf, scheduled to take place in Austin in November, will continue on as planned. Those who are heavily involved in the WooCommerce ecosystem will still be able to connect and build for the platform as they have done previously.</p>\n<h3>Democratizing Selling with WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>With Automattic now at the helm of the most dominant e-commerce platform on the web, it will be interesting to see if the company can make selling online just as simple as it has made publishing online. WordPress.com&#8217;s tremendous success can be partially attributed to the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to democratizing publishing</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I do believe that the web needs an open, independent and easy-to-use commerce platform that you can run yourself on your own website,&#8221;</strong> Mullenweg said in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJOfTB8-daA\" target=\"_blank\">video announcement</a>, the first video ever to be published to Automattic&#8217;s YouTube account.</p>\n<p>Publishing products and selling them on the web is arguably a more complex endeavor than simple publishing, especially when you factor in location, tax, payment gateways, and everything needed to process transactions. The average non-developer has no concept of what it takes to set up a blog, let alone an online store. But if Automattic can play a part in democratizing the ability for regular folks to sell products online, it has the potential to globally transform e-commerce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 May 2015 21:15:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Woo &amp; Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4529:\"<p>For years, we&#8217;ve been working on democratizing publishing, and today more people have independent sites built on open source software than ever before in the history of the web.

Everyone applauded; there’s long been demand for better ecommerce functionality, but it’s been outside the scope of what Automattic could do well.</p>\n<p>That changes today &#8212; drum roll &#8212; as <a href=\"http://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a> joins the <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> team to make it easier for people to sell online. <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/05/woothemes-joins-automattic/\">Along with Woo’s announcement</a>, here&#8217;s a short video explaining more:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>In the past few years, WooCommerce really distinguished itself in its field. Just like WordPress as a whole, it developed a robust community around its software, and its products meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.</p>\n<p>Woo is also a team after Automattic’s own distributed heart: WooCommerce is created and supported by 55 people in 16 countries. Added to Automattic&#8217;s 325 people in 37 countries, that’s a combined 380-person company across 42 countries &#8212; the sun never sets.* I can&#8217;t wait to meet all my new colleagues.</p>\n<p>Just like us, the vast majority of WooCommerce&#8217;s work is also open source and 100% GPL. And just like WordPress, you&#8217;ll find WooCommerce meetups popping up everywhere, from Los Angeles to London, and its global and community-focused work together to make the users’ experiences the best they can be.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-45072\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/05/ecomm-trends.png?resize=447%2C294\" alt=\"ecomm-trends\" /></a> The stats are impressive: the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce plugin has over 7.5 million downloads and a million+ active installs</a>; BuiltWith&#8217;s <a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\">survey of ecommerce platforms shows Woo passing up Magento in the top million</a>, with about triple the number of total sites. Even a conservative estimate that WooCommerce powers 650,000 storefronts means they’re enabling a huge number of independent sellers. They’ve added a tremendous amount to the WordPress ecosystem (alongside everyone else working in this area).</p>\n<p>WordPress currently <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\">powers about 23% of the web</a>. As we work our way toward 51%, WooCommerce joining Automattic is a big step opening WordPress up to an entirely new audience. I can’t wait to see how much more we can build together.</p>\n<p>Automattic <em>turns ten</em> next month: another amazing milestone I couldn&#8217;t have imagined a decade ago.

The <strong>do_action( ‘wordpress-charity-hackathon’ );</strong> event was so successful in 2014 that organizers were inspired to make it an annual event. The <a href=\"http://www.wpcapetown.co.za/event/do_action-wordpress-charity-hackathon-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">2015 hackathon</a> is scheduled for June 20th from 9:00 AM &#8211; 5:00 PM.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a team of nearly 50 volunteers from the community, we built brand new websites for nine different charitable organizations and we will be doing the same again this year,&#8221; said Hugh Lashbrooke, an organizer for the event.</p>\n<p>The concept will be the same as the previous year &#8211; volunteers will build sites for nine Capetown-based charities, giving each their own unique online presence by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>A few examples of websites built by the volunteers last year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feedinginaction.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Feeding in Action</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.stlukes.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Luke’s Hospice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.equinoxtrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Equinox Trust</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.carecareers.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Care Career Connection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theup.org.za/\" target=\"_blank\">The UPliftment Porgramme</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The charities this year are equally as deserving and spread across the whole spectrum of society again,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. The 2015 charities list includes organizations such as the Academy for Adults with Autism, FoodBank South Africa, and the Down Syndrome Inclusive Education Foundation NPC.</p>\n<p>Sponsors this year include <a href=\"http://hetzner.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Hetzner</a>, <a href=\"http://oboxthemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Obox</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WooThemes</a>.

Kurland is GoDaddy&#8217;s evangelist who travels to WordCamps and is the interface between various open source communities and GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>In the following post, Kurland shares his experience attending <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015\">DrupalCon Los Angeles</a>, a large conference devoted to <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As I flew from DrupalCon Los Angeles, CA to <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/wordcamp/wordcamp-maine-2015/\">WordCamp Maine</a>, I thought a lot about what the Drupal and WordPress communities could learn from each other. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> and Drupal are two community-built platforms and each community is powerful. We stand to learn a lot from each other, because<a href=\"https://mendel.me/articles/business/why-all-open-source-projects-matter/\"> all open source projects matter</a>.</p>\n<p>With an eye toward looking for the similarities, rather than the differences, both WordPress and Drupal are working to overcome similar obstacles including, brand recognition, threat mitigation, adoption, onboarding, contribution, the list goes on. So why did I go to <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015\">DrupalCon LA</a>? To learn and give back to another community that’s steeped in collaborative culture.</p>\n<h2>The Experience</h2>\n<p>Thousands of people attended <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/drupalcon/drupalcon-la/\">DrupalCon in Los Angeles</a> this year. It’s massive and the layout is similar to a large developer conference. There are sessions centered on technical, as well as business topics, and usually lively question and answer opportunities after each session. There’s a coder lounge, a contribution room, and a huge emphasis on contributing to coding sprints for the next release of Drupal, Drupal 8.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DrupalConLA.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-43971\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DrupalConLA.png?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"DrupalCon LA\" /></a>Photo via <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/drupalcon/drupalcon-la/#jp-carousel-16491\">Mendel</a>\n<h2>Leveling and Onboarding</h2>\n<p>Prior to the conference, DrupalCon had summits to help gather community members around a particular vertical or topic such as, higher education, community, business, and training sessions to help level-up skills based on experience.</p>\n<p>The theme of organizing around common interests is strong throughout the entire conference with<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/bofs/2015-05-12\"> birds of a feather sessions</a> and<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/events\"> topical social gatherings</a> with topics like,<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/women-drupal\"> women in Drupal</a> and<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/first-time-attendee-social\"> first time attendees</a>. When it comes to mobilizing around interest groups, Drupal does a brilliant job.</p>\n<h2>Comparing WordPress and Drupal</h2>\n<p>I’ve met a higher proportion of people who work on enterprise sites at DrupalCons and a higher proportion of people who work on small business sites at DrupalCamps, local conferences similar to WordCamps. There are some important lessons, however, that I took away from the Drupal community.</p>\n<h2><b>Lessons and Questions from DrupalCon</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Onboarding starts with education. The Drupal community puts an emphasis on training at just about every event while only a handful of WordCamps offer a <strong>Foundation Friday</strong> or some other local onboarding event.</li>\n<li>Building community means valuing the same things and aligning along common interests. BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions are a part of Drupal and other technical community conferences. There are certainly people with specific interests related to performance, security, women in WordPress, WP-CLI, etc. Should the WordPress community offer BoF sessions at WordCamps? Or are the existing <strong>tracks</strong> that many WordCamps offer enough?</li>\n<li>Networking with those who work in a similar vertical is important. Just as Drupal holds summits for particular verticals, the WordPress community is beginning to do the same with things like, <a href=\"https://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/announcing-buddycamp-miami-2015/\">BuddyCamp at WordCamp Miami</a>, <a href=\"http://conf.woocommerce.com/\">WooConf</a> (e-commerce), <a href=\"http://pressnomics.com/\">Pressnomics</a> (business), <a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/\">Prestige</a> (business), <a href=\"https://loopconf.io/\">LoopConf</a> (developer). Can more be done at WordCamps?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>It&#8217;s OK to Love Drupal Too</h2>\n<p>If you’re reading this article on the Tavern, you’re likely a WordPress loyalist. I love WordPress, and it’s also <strong>ok to love Drupal</strong>. They are both tools in an open source toolbox that we all share. The beauty of our opportunity as developers, designers, and creative professionals is our ability to create awesome things in a million different ways.</p>\n<p>In going to DrupalCon, it was refreshing for me to take a second to see the web development industry from another perspective.

At the end of 2003, just six months after Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">decided to fork b2</a>, a Japanese version of WordPress was available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPress-ME.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPress-ME.jpg?resize=748%2C299\" alt=\"WordPress-ME\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43607\" /></a></p>\n<p>The version was originally called &#8220;WordPress ME&#8221; and was maintained by a user called <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/otsukare/\" target=\"_blank\">Otsukare</a>, whose <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040802092512/http://wordpress.xwd.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">translation notes</a> indicate that he believed WordPress would become &#8220;convenient and increasingly easy to use in the future.&#8221; This Japanese version corresponded with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/10/072-final-version-available/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 0.72</a>, as WordPress wouldn&#8217;t have internationalization support until version 1.2.</p>\n<p>Otsukare was instrumental in demonstrating the demand for translation for all languages with the popularity of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed\" target=\"_blank\">multilingual fork of WordPress</a>, which allowed easy modification via the use of a language file. It is rumored that this multilingual edition, along with discussions on the WordPress ME fourms, was influential in bringing <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/gettext\" target=\"_blank\">gettext</a> into WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Growing the Japanese WordPress Community Through Local Meetups</h2>\n<p>Over the past 11 years, local Japanese WordPress communities have grown steadily. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/Nao\" target=\"_blank\">Naoko Takano</a>, who has been involved with the local community since 2003, attributes that growth to <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordcamp-europe2013\" target=\"_blank\">consistent translation and a reliable release workflow</a>, managed by a dedicated Japanese package team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/japanese-package-team.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/japanese-package-team.jpg?resize=625%2C247\" alt=\"japanese-package-team\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43918\" /></a></p>\n<p>An organized system around translation and documentation were two key ingredients that helped germinate the early Japanese WordPress community, but local meetups were ultimately the catalyst for its massive growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=wordcamptokyo2008\" target=\"_blank\">The first WordCamp Tokyo</a> was held in 2008 with 60 attendees. <a href=\"https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Tokyo</a> today now pulls in 1200 &#8211; 1400 people, according to co-organizer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shinichin\" target=\"_blank\">Shinichi Nishikawa</a>. This event is larger than past editions of WordCamps Europe and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Nishikawa reports that over the past seven years, Japan has hosted 15 WordCamps in Tokyo, Kyoto, Fukuoka, Yokohama Nagoyo, Kobe, and Osaka. <a href=\"https://kansai.wordcamp.org/2014/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kansai</a>, held in the Western part of the country, was organized by WordBench members of that area, including Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama.</p>\n<p>Regional WordPress groups in Japan are organized on <a href=\"http://WordBench.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordBench.org</a>, a site that allows users to find, join, and create a meetup. The site was <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/04/30/wordcamp-tokyo-2009-takayuki-miyoshi-introducing-wordpress-regional-community-wordbench/\" target=\"_blank\">created in 2009 by Takayuki Miyoshi</a>, the author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form 7</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; most popular plugins. WordBench has been running on BuddyPress for the past six years and was originally built on RC1 of the plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordbench.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordbench.png?resize=1025%2C672\" alt=\"wordbench\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43929\" /></a></p>\n<p>The site currently lists 48 local groups throughout Japan, named for their cities, i.e. WordBench Tokyo, WordBench Osaka, WordBench Kawasaki. Members and organizers use the site to post about upcoming events and recaps of meetups recently held in various locations. The site serves to keep Japan&#8217;s local communities connected and inspired.</p>\n<h2>Japan&#8217;s Unique WordPress Meetups and the Importance of Wapuu</h2>\n<p>In addition to the regional WordBench groups, interest-based meetups are also common in the Japanese WordPress community. In this format, members meet around different interests outside of WordPress, such as cooking or photography. For example, the <a href=\"https://shashinbu.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPhotoclub</a> meetup gathers together to go on walks and take photos. Members&#8217; <a href=\"http://8bitodyssey.com/archives/1547\" target=\"_blank\">photos</a> were printed and displayed at WordCamp Tokyo 2012.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://takamorry.com/article/20130209_wordcrab.html\" target=\"_blank\">WordCrab</a> is another example of one of Japan&#8217;s unique WordPress meetups. Members from all over from Japan gather in the Fukui prefecture, where they combine WordPress sessions with a giant <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=wordcrab&l=commderiv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1\" target=\"_blank\">crab party</a> where everyone feasts upon the region&#8217;s renowned crabs.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordcrab.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordcrab.jpg?resize=1025%2C586\" alt=\"photo credit: WordCrab meetup\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43936\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=wordcrab&l=commderiv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1\">WordCrab meetup</a>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://2014onsen.wbsendai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Word温泉 (WordOnsen) meetup</a> is centered around the enjoyment of hot springs. Members gather in Fukushima and stay at a hotel where they have WordPress sessions and a party night.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In meetups we started doing more things than just learning WordPress,&#8221; community organizer Shinichi Nishikawa said. &#8220;We get friends together and go for a walk and eat lunch/dinner together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this a really good way to make the community stronger. <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">People are talented in different things and by doing something together, other than WordPress, people can show their talents.</span> And of course, it’s fun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Japan&#8217;s holistic approach to meetups incorporates various aspects of life and relationships, as opposed to simply centering around improving WordPress technical skill. As a result, members become more connected and meetups are highly personalized. That&#8217;s where Wapuu enters the picture to bring special meaning to each group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ja.wordpress.org/about-wp-ja/wapuu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wapuu</a>, the official mascot character of WordPress, was designed by Kazuko Kaneuchi in 2011. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu\" target=\"_blank\">distributed under the GPLv2 or later</a> and can be modified by anyone to add more personality to the character.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to the freedom of the GPL, there have been many <a href=\"http://jawordpressorg.github.io/wapuu/\" target=\"_blank\">forked versions of Wapuu</a>,&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;All local Wapuus are created by someone who belongs to each local community and they hold something that represents where they are from.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/local-wapuu.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/local-wapuu.jpg?resize=627%2C349\" alt=\"photo credit:  Naoko Takano - WordPress History\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43943\" /></a>photo credit:<br />Naoko Takano &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordpress-history-21925968/42\">WordPress History</a>\n<p>Wapuu is so well-loved that the creature ends up making its way onto <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/odysseygate/8509556933/\" target=\"_blank\">swag</a>, cakes, and nail and coffee art at Japanese WordPress events.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wapuu-everywhere.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wapuu-everywhere.jpg?resize=1025%2C703\" alt=\"photo credit:  Naoko Takano - Learnings from Growing Local WordPress Communities\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43945\" /></a>photo credit:<br />Naoko Takano &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordcamp-europe2013/47\">Learnings from Growing Local WordPress Communities</a>\n<p>The name &#8220;Wapuu&#8221; was given to the mascot by a users&#8217; poll. &#8220;Japanese people pronounce WordPress as &#8216;WAADOPURESU,\'&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;Wapuu sounds like an abbreviation of WAADOPURESU, taking &#8216;Wa&#8217; and &#8216;Pu&#8217; from it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Modifications of the mascot have recently started popping up at WordCamps outside of Japan. <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp London&#8217;s wapuunk</a> was so popular that it inspired WordCamp Philly and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-wapuujlo-official-mascot-of-wordcamp-belgrade\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Belgrade</a> to create their own unique modifications to the character.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, Wapuu seems to have a special power to bring people together, regardless of culture or location. WordPress has the Japanese community to thank for its unique open source contribution to meetup branding.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges of Contributing to WordPress Across the Language Barrier</h2>\n<p>Despite having a large WordPress community thriving in Japan, with many of the <a href=\"http://www.sailor.co.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">top</a> <a href=\"http://womens.marathon-festival.com/2014/\" target=\"_blank\">websites</a> <a href=\"http://tasukeaijapan.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">built</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.kurashi-no-techo.co.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">software</a>, Japanese developers have a difficult time contributing back to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Language is the biggest barrier,&#8221; Nishikawa told the Tavern. &#8220;There are many good developers in Japan (and in other countries) who don’t speak English. Most of them can read documentation but joining in the conversation in tickets and on Slack is a different thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, there is English for native speakers and English for international people, and they are different,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s difficult to say how different they are, but for us who are not native, ambiguous words, abbreviations like &#8216;FWIW,&#8217; jokes, and slang are difficult,&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;Sometimes nesting a long sentence in another long sentence by using &#8216;that,&#8217; &#8216;which,&#8217; and &#8216;including&#8217; is difficult.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He explained that overcoming the language barrier is more than simply learning English; it also includes the hurdle of trying to understand the abbreviations and expressions that are infused by the culture around native English speakers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People would say that you can understand because it’s code, but if we look at the conversations in tickets, the surrounding discussion often concerns more than just the code,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Non-English speaking developers are trying to learn English, but it would be good if people in the ticket / Slack would keep in mind that there are people who don’t share the context or culture behind the words they write,&#8221; Nishikawa suggested.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we make the words and expressions easier to understand, someone who understands 80%  will have the opportunity to understand nearly 100%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Nishikawa is unsure of whether or not it is productive to request these kinds of changes, given that communication can never really be separated from culture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe a more welcoming atmosphere needed?&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the other hand, I know that the discussions include a great deal of context and many cultural things. It’s a place for communication, too. So, I don’t know if it’s right to say that something needs to change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, there are many talented developers who don’t understand English at all and I have no idea what can be done for them,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Nishikawa said that he felt much more connected to the community after attending WordCamp San Francisco and the following summit and contributor day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even for developers who didn&#8217;t speak English, we had translators and discussed things, looked at the code and shared the WordPress projects they are working on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After these face-to-face conversations, developers are more relaxed and motivated to work in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">core Make project</a>. Inviting developers to meetups/camps in the English world or inviting core contributors travel and join local contribution days will be a big trigger to involve more people.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Future of WordPress in Japan</h2>\n<p>Nishikawa believes that WordPress has a bright future in Japan, thanks to the efforts of Otsukare, Naoko Takano, Takayuki Miyoshi and all the plugin developers, Tenpura (the author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-multibyte-patch/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Multibyte Patch</a> plugin), bloggers, community organizers, an army of dedicated translators and more.</p>\n<p>He is hopeful that positive experiences for developers at global meetups like WCSF will help the Japanese WordPress community find ways to contribute back to core and other projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There have been a few people who had contributed separately, but now I feel there is a small groove of people who are more interested in contribution,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the community, we hope that the activeness of the Japanese community will be exported to other Asian (and global) communities, especially with Wapuu or the unique &#8220;more-than-learning&#8221; style of meetups.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also believes the future of WordPress in Japan will be brighter with the internationalization improvements that are continually being added to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the users, when everything is translatable, people are happier. If WordPress can become more mobile friendly, it will be used more by young people. When the WP-API is in core, there will be more diverse apps available.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nishikawa has had such a positive experience organizing WordPress community events in Japan that he is now active in growing the community in Thailand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We now have meetups twice per month in Bangkok for developers/users/designers. We don’t have &#8216;session-oriented meetups&#8217; anymore but we try to have casual talks every time, where everyone can speak in their own languages. Translation is more than welcome but we don’t want to rely on someone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Japan&#8217;s community-oriented approach to learning has paid off with highly active meetup groups and some of the largest WordCamps on the globe, Nishikawa is hoping to bring his experience to Thailand and help organize a WordCamp Bangkok in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Community has made my life/job much more exciting and fun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many things will differ culture by culture but the core value of community should be the same everywhere.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 May 2015 21:26:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: 2 Chocolate Chip Cookies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45056\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/2-chocolate-chip-cookies/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:494:\"<blockquote><p>Sometimes, you just want 2 chocolate chip cookies.

WP Contributions comes with a series of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-contributions/faq/\">template tags</a> for those who want more control over how the information is displayed.</p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d like to see in a future version is short code support. This way, users could create a WP Contributions page on their site with easy to use short codes. It&#8217;s not supported now, but Filippini informs me that a future version will include the ability to display badges attached to a WordPress.org user profile.</p>\n<p>As WordPress <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/\">continues to increase in marketshare</a>, the ability to show how much you&#8217;ve contributed to the project is a huge resume booster, especially if you can say your code runs on millions of sites. In early 2014, WordPress made substantial <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profile-redesign-is-live\">improvements to user profiles</a> but there&#8217;s no easy way to display those contributions to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>WP Contributions does a decent job filling the void and is available for free on the WordPress.org plugin directory.

Lasso is sold through his storefront and is also in use on <a href=\"https://story.am/\" target=\"_blank\">Story.am</a>, the hosted platform for <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/?s=Aesop+Story+Engine\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Story Engine</a>. Haskins recently <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/story-am-relaunches-now-100-free\" target=\"_blank\">made accounts on Story.am available for free</a> in hopes of garnering more feedback on the Lasso editing experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/building-with-lasso.gif\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/building-with-lasso.gif?resize=900%2C618\" alt=\"building-with-lasso\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43867\" /></a></p>\n<p>As of today, <a href=\"https://github.com/AesopInteractive/lasso\" target=\"_blank\">Lasso is now available on GitHub</a> for developers and users to test and offer feedback/contribution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This decision was several months in the making,&#8221; Haskins told the Tavern. &#8220;It included conversations with developers who have their commercially sold code publicly available, as well as A/B testing our presence to verify that the move would be both beneficial to the plugin, as well as the user base that it’s attracting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Making the code public is a calculated risk, which he hopes will not damage sales of the plugin but rather increase its visibility. Haskins recently published a <a href=\"http://aesopinteractive.com/jan-april-2015-report/\" target=\"_blank\">financial transparency report</a> on his 15 month old company, which indicates that Aesop Interactive is on track to double its revenue in 2015 based on numbers from January &#8211; April. Sales of the Lasso product totaled $4,408.36.</p>\n<p>As the plugin is open source, you are free to use it anywhere, but Haskins notes that support will only be offered to customers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here. We do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. We cannot provide support to anyone who does not hold a valid license key.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I decided to make it public today after I was invited in to collaborate on another publicly available commercially sold plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just needed a final excuse, and that was it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haskins is not the first developer to make a commercial WordPress product available on GitHub for contribution. Earlier this year, the folks behind GravityView decided to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/gravityview-is-now-public-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">make their plugin public on GitHub</a> after being inspired by a <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/interview-matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion between Matt Medeiros and Matt Mullenweg</a> on ubiquity vs. scarcity as it relates to WordPress product businesses:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The one pattern I see most right now that I think is not sustainable is, and it’s because it’s the easiest thing to do, is businesses that are built on a scarcity – the thing not being widely available. If you think about some of the coolest successes so far in WordPress, the Gravity Forms, some of the theme businesses, they are inherently predicated on the fact that you have to pay to access them.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a fan of businesses that grow with ubiquity, that become more powerful the more ubiquitous they are, more valuable. WordPress itself is one of these. Akismet is one of these. Jetpack is certainly one of those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This approach brings up the question of whether or not a commercial plugin developer can run a successful business while giving the code away for free on GitHub. A select few are finding that the benefits of community contribution and feedback outweigh the risk.</p>\n<p>Haskin&#8217;s frontend editing plugin is a prime candidate to explore this approach, as this type of plugin was created for users of all technical skill levels. Customers interested in this functionality are less likely to be comfortable installing and updating plugins from GitHub. If you&#8217;ve been eager to try Lasso but couldn&#8217;t get past the <a href=\"https://lasso.is/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">$129 price tag</a>, now is your opportunity to <a href=\"https://github.com/AesopInteractive/lasso\" target=\"_blank\">download the plugin</a> and put it through the paces.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 May 2015 20:22:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: SiteGround is Organizing Bulgaria’s First PHP Conference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=43825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/siteground-is-organizing-bulgarias-first-php-conference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2868:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bulgaria-php-conference.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bulgaria-php-conference.jpg?resize=670%2C287\" alt=\"bulgaria-php-conference\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43829\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com\" target=\"_blank\">SiteGround</a> is organizing the first ever <a href=\"http://www.bgphp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulgaria PHP conference to be held in Sofia</a>, September 25-27, 2015.

Both cultures are built on some of the same values, like sharing knowledge and open sourcing happiness. With the explosion of the craft beer scene over the past few years, many new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/30-beautiful-brewery-websites-built-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">breweries are opting to build their websites on top of WordPress</a>. When you&#8217;re bootstrapping a new brewery, the last thing you need to spend money on is proprietary software.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community has many free and open source tools that developers can use to build a beer-centered website. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beer-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">Beer Directory</a> is a new plugin released this year by Jami Gibbs, founder of <a href=\"https://rescuethemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Themes</a>. She created it to support beer listings on her commercial <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/brewery-a-wordpress-theme-for-beer-makers/full_screen_preview/10941216\" target=\"_blank\">Brewery</a> theme.</p>\n<p>Beer Directory gives you an easy way to enter beers and their details in the admin. It allows you to categorize and group beers, enter details, and display listings via a configurable shortcode. The post type includes fields for ABV, IBU, OG, FG, SRM/Color, Malts, Hops, and Yeast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-profile.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-profile.jpg?resize=1025%2C797\" alt=\"beer-profile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43790\" /></a></p>\n<p>I tested the plugin by adding the details from a <a href=\"https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/put-the-blueberries-in-the-basket\" target=\"_blank\">blueberry sour beer recipe</a>. The output for an individual listing on the frontend will look something like this, depending on your active theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-listing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-listing.jpg?resize=626%2C872\" alt=\"beer-listing\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43791\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes a shortcode for listing an individual beer: <code>[beer id=\"17\"]</code> and one for displaying all listings: <code>[beer]</code>. The shortcodes can be configured by count, category, id, and any of the WordPress <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters\" target=\"_blank\">Order &amp; Orderby Parameters</a>. Beer posts also include support for a featured image.</p>\n<p>Be advised that this is not a beer recipe plugin, so there&#8217;s no easy way to enter your hop schedule, amounts for fermentables, temperatures, etc. Beer Directory was created purely for listing beers on the frontend with a few key details. If you need to enter beer recipes, the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-share-beer-recipes-in-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">BeerXML Shortcode plugin</a>, created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/derekspringer\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Springer</a>, is a more suitable option.</p>\n<p>The Beer Directory plugin is perfect for home brewers, professional breweries, or even beer enthusiasts who want to maintain a personal library of beers they enjoy. With this data saved in a custom post type, it will be transferable no matter how many times you change your WordPress theme. In addition to keeping track of your beers, the admin listing allows you to easily search and sort your library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-in-the-admin.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-in-the-admin.jpg?resize=1025%2C344\" alt=\"beer-in-the-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43807\" /></a></p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I can confirm that it works as advertised. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beer-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">Beer Directory</a> is fully translatable and available for free on WordPress.org. If you want to contribute to development, the plugin can also be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/RescueThemes/beer-directory\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 May 2015 01:31:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:10:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 16:12:34 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"226527\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 16:00:14 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911040210\";}','no'),(801,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1433218357','no'),(802,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1433175157','no'),(803,'_transient_timeout_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','1433218359','no'),(804,'_transient_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','a:4:{s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"rss\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"channel\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WordPress Plugins » View: Most Popular\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WordPress Plugins » View: Most Popular\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"language\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"en-US\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 16:06:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"generator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"http://bbpress.org/?v=1.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"item\";a:30:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"\n			\n			\n			\n			\n			\n			\n					\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Contact Form 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/#post-2141\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2007 12:45:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"2141@http://wordpress.org/plugins/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Just another contact form plugin.

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHere are some examples of each.\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\r\n<h3>Some local proposals</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b><a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">ECA\'s Recommendations for the Next Mayor of Philadelphia</a>: </b>UNLEASH THE POWER OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO GROW PHILADELPHIA’S ECONOMY AND CREATE LOCAL JOBS<a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\">\r\n</a>A lot of the energy efficiency (EE) work will pay for itself within a year or two.  We\'ve heard about a suburban school implementing EE and saving 40% of their energy cost, which could go right back into the school budget.

Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','publish','open','open','','policy','','','2015-05-30 21:09:27','2015-05-31 01:09:27','',0,'https://pesphl.wordpress.com/?page_id=10',0,'page','',2),(31,2,'2015-04-08 20:12:59','2015-04-08 20:12:59','<strong>Welcome!</strong>\n\nPeoples Energy Solutions is an action committee of, <strong>(Name TBD)</strong>, a large &amp; growing coalition committed to a just and sustainable future for Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia is home to an abundance of talent, imagination, and proven successes when it comes to sustainability.

Hard-working Philadelphians have already laid the groundwork of the imagination for our next era, and the solutions we need are right in front of us. We believe that the key to the future of Philadelphia lies in investment in practical, proven, community-based solutions, rather than corporate deals which cut jobs and exist only to siphon off more wealth into the hands of those who are not invested in the future of our communities.\r\n<h4>LEADERSHIP FROM THE GROUND UP</h4>\r\nWith the right leadership, these solutions will work for everybody, improving the health of communities, creating jobs, expanding public services, and turning Philadelphia into a national leader for the twenty-first century. <em>Bright Philly Future</em> is committed to being your guide to these ideas and the organizations who are working to make them reality.\r\n<h4>TRANSPARENCY</h4>\r\nWe believe that the future direction of our city should be decided through an open and transparent process, not in closed-door meetings between powerful economic interests and select politicians.\r\n<h4>DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY</h4>\r\nWe believe in an economy that works for everyone, not just a privileged few, a plan that puts equal justice, living wage jobs, clean air and water, and public safety ahead of corporate profits.\r\n<h4>POLITICAL WILL</h4>\r\nWe know that the technology already exists to meet our energy needs responsibly, without sacrificing health and safety or contributing to catastrophic climate change, and that the only thing standing in our way is the lack of political will to wholeheartedly embrace a sustainable future. Our purpose is to create that will!\r\n<h4>COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION</h4>\r\nWe welcome input from responsible businesses, neighborhood associations, working families, students, senior citizens, and all Philadelphians interested in building a future that is just, sustainable, healthy and secure.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gardening</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG2eHQ9Q078\">Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m9y53sa\">About Permaculture\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m9y53sa\">What Your Garden Can Teach About Cities\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Aquaponics\">About Aquaponics\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/\">Hugelculture - An Advanced Raised Bed\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/k76y48w\">New study shows how trees clean the air in London</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Transportation</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ou2lnax\">Study of vehicle emissions will aid urban sustainability efforts\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/oy4gtem\">Inexpensive Electric Cars May Arrive Sooner Than You Think</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Community Capital\r\n</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://timebanks.org/more-about-timebanking/\">Time Banking</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://ilsr.org/\">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG2eHQ9Q078\">\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://transitiontownmedia.org/about-us/what-is-transition-town-media/\">Transition Town (Media, PA)</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.transitionnetwork.org/about\">Transition Network\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://planphilly.com/\">Plan Philly\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.phillynn.org/home/default.php\">Philadelphia Neighborhood Networks</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n--','What we propose','','publish','open','closed','','what-we-propose','','','2015-05-28 21:07:13','2015-05-29 01:07:13','',24,'https://pesphl.wordpress.com/?page_id=70',0,'page','',0),(72,2,'2015-04-09 01:34:13','2015-04-09 05:34:13','<strong></strong><em>Bright Philly Future</em> grew out of a coalition that came together in response to the news of a December 5, 2014 closed-door conference bringing wealthy investors and representatives of international corporations together to lay plans for turning our city into an “Energy Hub”.

That the panelists were likewise from all around the US. That there was no representation from public health professionals, nor any mention of public health.  Who will speak for the people? When citizens began questioning Councilman Oh, the reply was... I don\'t work for you. So the questions, and the attacks, on industry continued. And yes, security was called to protect industry from citizens, and one by one, the citizens were escorted out.\n\nSome of what happened was covered by the media.

And plans to gain a balanced education around this subject by inviting public health professionals and those in the renewable energy field to a future forum.  We, as citizens of greater Philadelphia, have concerns. Concerns about air quality from increased emissions. Concerns about water quality when we hear about a tunnel under the Delaware river. Concerns about pipelines coming through our properties, bringing the Marcellus gas into our region. Concerns about trains exploding from the increased volume of dirty fossil fuels headed our way.\n\nWe invite Councilman Oh, and all of City Council to look to the future. A future with reduced greenhouse gases, a future with solar panels or greenery on every roof, a future with fewer cars and more rapid transit, a bright green future for future generations.

For example, a Center for American Progress study found that 2.5 to 4 more jobs are created for each million dollars spent on energy efficiency measures, like retrofitting and mass transit, than jobs from one million dollars spent on oil and natural gas operations.\"</blockquote>','Philadelphia\'s Energy Future','','publish','open','open','','philadelphias-energy-future','','','2015-04-20 14:11:24','2015-04-20 14:11:24','',0,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/?p=183',0,'post','',0),(196,1,'2015-04-29 02:29:17','0000-00-00 00:00:00','In what is likely a prelude to an announcement from the Pope in June Cardinal Peter Turkson called for','Vatican official calls for leaders to start awakening to climate science','','draft','open','open','','','','','2015-04-29 02:29:17','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/?p=196',0,'post','',0),(198,1,'2015-05-01 14:37:11','2015-05-01 14:37:11','Great little video posted by <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/mayor/Street_Level_Living_with_a_refinery_in_South_Philly.html\" target=\"_blank\">Philly.com</a> with West Passyunk Neighbors Association Jennifer Harrison discussing living next door to the PES oil refinery in South Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nShe details how the monitoring station instructs local residents that they should drive less and consume less energy in order to breath cleaner air.  In a classic blame the victim mentality, the implication would be that the oil refined at PES is emitting vast amounts of particulate emissions each year and we are at fault for that because we drive and use light bulbs.\r\n\r\nOf course the truth is if everyone in Philadelphia stopped driving and using electricity tomorrow the amount of emissions from the refinery wouldn\'t lower by one particle, but we will still have to breath it in.\r\n\r\nThe video closing with Harrison asking the poignant question of how would the next mayor deal with the issues that are arising for people who have to live next door to an energy hub.\r\n\r\nThe article and video are part of a series about \"little things\" around Philly that never get fixed, and they are looking to talk to other leaders of RCO\'s about issues the next mayor should be made aware of.  All things clean air and refinery related would seem like perfect topics, so if you are an RCO or know an RCO have them contact Gregg Gethard at gregg_gethard@yahoo.com or call (215)854-2267.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Living Next Door to an Energy Hub','','publish','open','open','','living-next-door-to-an-energy-hub','','','2015-05-14 02:47:57','2015-05-14 02:47:57','',0,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/?p=198',0,'post','',0),(208,1,'2015-05-05 03:34:49','2015-05-05 07:34:49','Bright Philly Future is the educational and resources arm of a coalition of forward-looking organizations in Philadelphia and the surrounding region, committed to bringing about a just and democratic transition to a sustainable future based on clean, renewable energy, stable living-wage jobs and an economy that works for all.\r\n\r\nOn this website you can educate yourself about the issues that face our city, our region and our world, connect to the organizations and campaigns that are making a difference, and learn how you can get involved at any level from improving your health and saving money by lowering your own carbon footprint to joining any one of dozens of campaigns, events and groups working together for a Bright Philly Future.','About Us','','publish','open','closed','','about-us','','','2015-05-29 15:33:00','2015-05-29 19:33:00','',0,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/?page_id=208',0,'page','',0),(214,1,'2015-04-13 01:54:17','2015-04-13 01:54:17','Philly.com posted an <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-04-13/news/61108220_1_largest-oil-refinery-philadelphia-energy-solutions-pollution\">excellent article</a> yesterday which highlights how no-brainer the real choice over the debate about having a refinery within the confines of our city.  Good paying union jobs always sound great, however the price we are paying for them is jaw dropping.\r\n<blockquote>In 2013, according to the latest statistics available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the site - the largest oil refinery on the East Coast - let loose 701,284 pounds (or more than 350 tons) of hazardous air pollutants, including roughly 29 tons of benzene, a potent carcinogen, and many more tons of other toxins that experts say can contribute to breathing problems such as asthma.</blockquote>\r\nThey also go on to highlight how these raw numbers translate into what happens when you live here.\r\n<blockquote>The continued pollution is a cause for concern for advocates and public-health experts alike, who note that Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the nation. Dr. Marilyn Howarth of the University of Pennsylvania\'s Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology said the asthma rate of about 26 percent among kids in some of the city\'s poorest neighborhoods is three times the national average.</blockquote>\r\nThere\'s more.\r\n<blockquote>\"The refinery has traditionally contributed a great deal of pollution to the Philadelphia region, and as the refinery operations increase . . . you can only reasonably expect these emissions to increase,\" Howarth said. The Philadelphia region currently fails to meet federal clean-air standards for ozone and small-particulate matter, two crucial pollution yardsticks.</blockquote>\r\nIt\'s even worse then that.\r\n<blockquote>An EPA analysis of South Philadelphia toxic pollution released last fall found that the vast majority of emissions in the neighborhood came from the refinery and that 11 percent - nearly 40 tons - were known carcinogens, largely benzene. The two biggest sources - roughly two-thirds of the total - were sulfuric acid and hydrogen cyanide.\r\n\r\n\"Those are acids,\" said Howarth of the sulfur-laced emissions, \"and they are very strong pollutants. They may not cause cancer, but they certainly contribute to asthma and would irritate the airways for people with chronic pulmonary disease.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo basically it\'s a pretty clear connection between having a refinery in our city and not having acceptable clean air, having huge rates of asthma, significant risks to children and the elderly and infirm especially and increased risks of cancer.\r\n\r\nWant to know how many jobs we get for all that?  845.  To put that into perspective TWU Local 234 is just one of 17 unions with SEPTA provides over 5000 jobs alone.\r\n\r\nThe article also quotes the man who is profiting vastly from endangering and harming so many (and who does not live near his refinery) Phil Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions which runs the refinery.  He is sure that opposition to an energy hub in Philadelphia is rooted in \"naivete\" and that he clearly believes that society cannot endure without burning fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nHowever the actual truth is that society cannot operate for much longer <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/\">burning fossil fuels like we are now</a>, and the time for when this must end is shorter then most people realize.   This makes any further investment like pipelines and new refineries a terrible short sighted idea even ignoring the terrible health effects they clearly have.  Mr Rinaldi will likely deny this as long as he possibly can, however he is the one who is naive if he thinks Philadelphians will let him pollute our city and our bodies so he can become unimaginably wealthy in the process without a fight.  A really big fight.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','845 jobs vs all of our lungs and the future of our city, world','','publish','open','open','','845-jobs-vs-all-of-our-lungs-and-the-future-of-our-city-world','','','2015-05-14 01:54:16','2015-05-14 01:54:16','',0,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/?p=214',0,'post','',0),(215,1,'2015-05-10 02:36:01','2015-05-10 02:36:01','','0413_PXREFI13_1024_2','','inherit','open','open','','0413_pxrefi13_1024_2','','','2015-05-10 02:36:01','2015-05-10 02:36:01','',214,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0413_PXREFI13_1024_2.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(218,1,'2015-05-10 03:11:29','2015-05-10 03:11:29','','Philadelphia1973_01_2000','','inherit','open','open','','philadelphia1973_01_2000','','','2015-05-10 03:11:29','2015-05-10 03:11:29','',0,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Philadelphia1973_01_2000.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(220,1,'2015-05-12 01:57:41','2015-05-12 01:57:41',' ','','','publish','open','open','','220','','','2015-05-28 20:59:14','2015-05-29 00:59:14','',24,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/12/220/',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(221,1,'2015-05-12 01:57:41','2015-05-12 01:57:41',' ','','','publish','open','open','','221','','','2015-05-28 20:59:14','2015-05-29 00:59:14','',0,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/12/221/',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(222,1,'2015-05-12 01:57:41','2015-05-12 01:57:41','','Get Action, Be Sane','','publish','open','open','','get-action-be-sane','','','2015-05-12 01:57:41','2015-05-12 01:57:41','',0,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/12/get-action-be-sane/',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(223,1,'2015-05-12 01:57:41','2015-05-12 01:57:41',' ','','','publish','open','open','','223','','','2015-05-28 06:32:52','2015-05-28 10:32:52','',0,'http://bpf2.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/12/223/',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(225,1,'2015-04-13 01:41:20','2015-04-13 01:41:20','This is an example page.

Williams has also <a href=\"http://www.jvpphilly.org/media/2015/4/2/jvp-questions-anthony-williams-on-islamophobic-associates\" target=\"_blank\">refused to distance himself from anti-Muslim extremists</a>.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Williams is divisive and toxic to Philadelphia, but that he has a serious chance of winning if the vote is split between Kenney and other candidates with progressive politics. This would be tragic for Philadelphia in many ways, and would mark a turning from the green agenda of the Nutter administration backwards toward a 19th century vision of pollution, economic stagnation and accelerating climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThere has been some concern expressed in environmental circles about the presence of Phil Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, on Jim\'s Policy Committee. We also were concerned about this and asked for a meeting with Jim and his policy chief, which turned out to be extremely productive.\r\n\r\nOur team of representatives from interfaith groups, environmental groups, labor &amp; business, all opposed to the dirty energy hub, new pipelines, dangerous oil trains, and fracking, found Kenney most willing to listen to us as we educated him and his team about the moral issues around climate change as well as the value of green investment over fossil fuel investment in creating jobs without sacrificing clean air, clean water and clean food.\r\n\r\nAs proof of this commitment, Jim has publicly committed to an <a href=\"https://kenney2015.com/media-releases/kenney-2015-releases-environment-transportation-policy-paper\" target=\"_blank\">open and democratic process for our energy future</a> and has added a <a href=\"https://kenney2015.com/media-releases/kenney-2015-policy-committee\" target=\"_blank\">trio of extraordinary environmental advocates to his policy team</a>:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Dr. Poune Saberi practices as an occupational &amp; environmental medicine physician, and serves on the boards of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Professor Kenneth Lande has taught at the University of Pennsylvania since 1959. He is one of the most prestigious physicists in the US and is known for his extensive research on the impact of fossil fuel extraction and use on health, safety and the environment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Dianne Herrin is a green development champion with training and experience with LEED Operations and Maintenance, carbon accounting/reporting, municipal energy planning, energy master planning, and has ISO 50001 certification.</p>\r\nThese three advocates will be at the table when energy and economic development decisions are made in the Kenney administration.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Kenney policy team included substantial input from us into a <a href=\"https://kenney2015.com/assets/uploads/general/21st-Century-Transportation-and-Environment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new energy policy for Philadelphia</a>. We’re delighted with the result, which includes a goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2050.\r\n\r\nWith three world-class policy advisors with extensive policy background on his team, Kenney actually has the expertise and experience at his disposal to move on concrete, doable steps toward this goal. The policy doesn’t just talk about carbon reduction. It lays out specific policy to reduce building energy use, to reduce the emissions from the City fleet, to implement a green (and local) procurement program, to incentivize renewable energy, to encourage more green roof infrastructure, and more!\r\n\r\nWe believe this puts Kenney head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates, even those who claim to support green development but don\'t put forward specific plans and still maintain that a fossil fuel hub can be achieved without environmental sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA week before our crucial meeting with Jim and his team, <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/4/24/grid-endorses-nelson-diaz-for-mayor.html\" target=\"_blank\">GRID magazine endorsed Nelson Diaz</a> for Mayor.  Many of us were disappointed to see this from a local magazine educating our region on sustainability, but found it understandable because Kenney\'s new appointments and policy had not become public. Now, there is no reason not to feel GREAT leaving the voting booth, not wasting a vote on a candidate who can\'t win, but propelling a true champion into office.\r\n\r\nLast we heard, Diaz only had 4% at the polls.  This primary could be won by a narrow margin, so remember that voting for Diaz is taking a vote from Kenney, and handing it to Anthony Williams, the corporate candidate, financed by the fracking industry, school privatizers and anti-Muslim voices.\r\n\r\nWe could continue wringing our hands and complaining about inaction on climate and corruption from our politicians. Or we can engage in conversation with them, and <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2851231/this_ought_to_be_the_climate_change_election_so_why_isnt_it.html\" target=\"_blank\">make this the Climate Change election it ought to be</a>.\r\n\r\nA few more points about Jim Kenney: He’s local, born, educated and lived all his life in Philly, and committed to all of its residents.

The lineup includes Jim Kenney, Nelson Diaz, Lynne Abraham, Anthony Williams, and Doug Oliver &amp; Milton Street. Whoever wins in the primaries next week in effect becomes our next Mayor after the November elections. Of the 6, Jim Kenney rises to the top.\r\n\r\n<strong>He\'s local</strong>.  Born, schooled, and worked in this city, so I hear. Our local paper, the Inquirer, wrote <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-07/news/61869256_1_jim-kenney-police-brutality-civilian-review-board\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> about him on May 7th: \"Kenney called passionate, loyal to a fault, driven to do right\".

Examples abound in his openness to LGBT rights, to marijuana reform, to immigration reform. And now, to dealing with climate disruption in our region.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Looking at recent polls, we felt Kenney had a winning chance of becoming our next Mayor. Except for the fact that he had Phil Rinaldi, the man behind the dirty energy hub plan, on his advisory team.

About creating jobs as well as a clean air, clean water and clean food. About creating an open and democratic process for our energy future. And added a trio of professionals to his policy team: a public health person, a scientist and a clean energy person. We applaud his listening.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">And we\'ve helped the Kenney team to craft an energy policy for Philadelphia. We\'re pleased with the result, which includes a goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2050.</p>\r\nA week earlier, GRID magazine endorsed <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/4/24/grid-endorses-nelson-diaz-for-mayor.html\">Nelson Diaz for Mayor</a>.  Many of us were disappointed to see this from a local magazine educating our region on sustainability.  We\'ve since realized that this was before the Kenney energy policy was public.

Williams has also refused to distance himself from anti-Muslim extremists.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Williams is divisive and toxic to Philadelphia, but that he has a serious chance of winning if the vote is split between Kenney and other candidates with progressive politics. This would be tragic for Philadelphia in many ways, and would mark a turning from the green agenda of the Nutter administration backwards toward a 19th century vision of pollution, economic stagnation and accelerating climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThere has been some concern expressed in environmental circles about the presence of Phil Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, on Jim\'s Policy Committee. We also were concerned about this and asked for a meeting with Jim and his policy chief, which turned out to be extremely productive.\r\n\r\nOur team of representatives from interfaith groups, environmental groups, labor &amp; business, all opposed to the dirty energy hub, new pipelines, dangerous oil trains, and fracking, found Kenney most willing to listen to us as we educated him and his team about the moral issues around climate change as well as the value of green investment over fossil fuel investment in creating jobs without sacrificing clean air, clean water and clean food.\r\n\r\nAs proof of this commitment, Jim has publicly committed to an open and democratic process for our energy future and has added a trio of extraordinary environmental advocates to his policy team:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Dr. Poune Saberi is the section chief for Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Philadelphia VA Medical Center and clinical faculty at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania. She serves on the national and Philadelphia board of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Professor Kenneth Lande has taught at the University of Pennsylvania since 1959. He is one of the most prestigious physicists in the US and is known for his extensive research on the impact of fossil fuel extraction and use on health, safety and the environment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Dianne Herrin, put forward by the Sustainable Business Alliance, is a green development champion with training and experience with LEED Operations and Maintenance, carbon accounting/reporting, municipal energy planning, energy master planning, and has ISO 50001 certification.</p>\r\nThese three advocates will be at the table when energy and economic development decisions are made in the Kenney administration.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Kenney policy team included substantial input from us into a new energy policy for Philadelphia. We’re delighted with the result, which includes a goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2050.\r\n\r\nWith three world-class policy advisors with extensive policy background on his team, Kenney actually has the expertise and experience at his disposal to move on concrete, doable steps toward this goal. The policy doesn’t just talk about carbon reduction. It lays out specific policy to reduce building energy use, to reduce the emissions from the City fleet, to implement a green (and local) procurement program, to incentivize renewable energy, to encourage more green roof infrastructure, and more!\r\n\r\nWe believe this puts Kenney head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates, even those who claim to support green development but don\'t put forward specific plans and still maintain that a fossil fuel hub can be achieved without environmental sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA week before the crucial meeting with Jim and his team, GRID magazine endorsed Nelson Diaz for Mayor.  Many of us were disappointed to see this from a local magazine educating our region on sustainability, but found it understandable because the new appointments and policy had not become public. Now, there is no reason not to feel GREAT leaving the voting booth, not wasting a vote on a candidate who can\'t win, but propelling a true champion into office.\r\n\r\nLast we heard, Diaz only had 4% at the polls.  This primary could be won by a narrow margin, so remember that voting for Diaz is taking a vote from Kenney, and handing it to Anthony Williams, the corporate candidate, financed by the fracking industry, school privatizers and anti-Muslim voices.  To put it in 2 words: Ralph Nader.\r\n\r\nWe could continue wringing our hands and complaining about inaction on climate and corruption from our politicians.

He is one of the most prestigious physicists in the US and is known for his extensive research on the impact of fossil fuel extraction and use on health, safety and the environment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Dianne Herrin is a green development champion with training and experience with LEED Operations and Maintenance, carbon accounting/reporting, municipal energy planning, energy master planning, and has ISO 50001 certification.</p>\r\nThese three advocates will be at the table when energy and economic development decisions are made in the Kenney administration.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Kenney policy team included substantial input from us into a <a href=\"https://kenney2015.com/assets/uploads/general/21st-Century-Transportation-and-Environment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new energy policy for Philadelphia</a>. We’re delighted with the result, which includes a goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2050.\r\n\r\nWith three world-class policy advisors with extensive policy background on his team, Kenney actually has the expertise and experience at his disposal to move on concrete, doable steps toward this goal. The policy doesn’t just talk about carbon reduction. It lays out specific policy to reduce building energy use, to reduce the emissions from the City fleet, to implement a green (and local) procurement program, to incentivize renewable energy, to encourage more green roof infrastructure, and more!\r\n\r\nWe believe this puts Kenney head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates, even those who claim to support green development but don\'t put forward specific plans and still maintain that a fossil fuel hub can be achieved without environmental sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA week before our crucial meeting with Jim and his team, <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/4/24/grid-endorses-nelson-diaz-for-mayor.html\" target=\"_blank\">GRID magazine endorsed Nelson Diaz</a> for Mayor.  Many of us were disappointed to see this from a local magazine educating our region on sustainability, but found it understandable because Kenney\'s new appointments and policy had not become public. Now, there is no reason not to feel GREAT leaving the voting booth, not wasting a vote on a candidate who can\'t win, but propelling a true champion into office.\r\n\r\nLast we heard, Diaz only had 4% at the polls.  This primary could be won by a narrow margin, so remember that voting for Diaz is taking a vote from Kenney, and handing it to Anthony Williams, the corporate candidate, financed by the fracking industry, school privatizers and anti-Muslim voices.  To put it in 2 words: Ralph Nader.\r\n\r\nWe could continue wringing our hands and complaining about inaction on climate and corruption from our politicians. Or we can engage in conversation with them, and <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2851231/this_ought_to_be_the_climate_change_election_so_why_isnt_it.html\" target=\"_blank\">make this the Climate Change election it ought to be</a>.\r\n\r\nA few more points about Jim Kenney: He’s local, born, educated and lived all his life in Philly, and committed to all of its residents. Our local paper, <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-07/news/61869256_1_jim-kenney-police-brutality-civilian-review-board\" target=\"_blank\">the Inquirer, wrote this</a> about him on May 7th: “Kenney called passionate, loyal to a fault, driven to do right.” Earlier, on May 3rd, a Philadelphia Magazine article, <a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/news/2015/05/03/jim-kenney-mayor-endorsement/\" target=\"_blank\">The (New) Jim Kenney for Mayor</a>, explained his evolution from an impassioned young man to a seasoned politician.\r\n\r\nHe’s experienced around City Hall.

Dr. Marilyn Howarth of the University of Pennsylvania\'s Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology said the asthma rate of about 26 percent among kids in some of the city\'s poorest neighborhoods is three times the national average.</blockquote>\nThere\'s more.\n<blockquote>\"The refinery has traditionally contributed a great deal of pollution to the Philadelphia region, and as the refinery operations increase . . . you can only reasonably expect these emissions to increase,\" Howarth said. The Philadelphia region currently fails to meet federal clean-air standards for ozone and small-particulate matter, two crucial pollution yardsticks.</blockquote>\nIt\'s even worse then that.\n<blockquote>An EPA analysis of South Philadelphia toxic pollution released last fall found that the vast majority of emissions in the neighborhood came from the refinery and that 11 percent - nearly 40 tons - were known carcinogens, largely benzene. The two biggest sources - roughly two-thirds of the total - were sulfuric acid and hydrogen cyanide.\n\n\"Those are acids,\" said Howarth of the sulfur-laced emissions, \"and they are very strong pollutants. They may not cause cancer, but they certainly contribute to asthma and would irritate the airways for people with chronic pulmonary disease.\"</blockquote>\nSo basically it\'s a pretty clear connection between having a refinery in our city and not having acceptable clean air, having huge rates of asthma, significant risks to children and the elderly and infirm especially and increased risks of cancer.\n\nWant to know how many jobs we get for all that?  845.  To put that into perspective TWU Local 234 is just one of 17 unions with SEPTA provides over 5000 jobs alone.\n\nThe article also quotes the man who is profiting vastly from endangering and harming so many (and who does not live near his refinery) Phil Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions which runs the refinery.  He is sure that opposition to an energy hub in Philadelphia is rooted in \"naivete\" and that he clearly believes that society cannot endure without burning fossil fuels.\n\nHowever the actual truth is that society cannot operate for much longer <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/\">burning fossil fuels like we are now</a>, and the time for when this must end is shorter then most people realize.   This makes any further investment like pipelines and new refineries a terrible short sighted idea even ignoring the terrible health effects they clearly have.  Mr Rinaldi will likely deny this as long as he possibly can, however he is the one who is naive if he thinks Philadelphians will let him pollute our city and our bodies so he can become unimaginably wealthy in the process without a fight.  A really big fight.\n\n&nbsp;','845 jobs vs all of our lungs and the future of our city, world','','inherit','open','open','','214-revision-v1','','','2015-05-13 18:34:42','2015-05-13 18:34:42','',214,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/13/214-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(268,2,'2015-05-13 18:35:31','2015-05-13 18:35:31','Despite reading, learning, talking about energy for the past several months, I just stumbled upon this blog post (<a href=\"http://www.greenphillyblog.com/sponsored-post/support-clean-local-energy-hub-choose-pa-wind-2015/\">Support a Clean, Local Energy Hub: Choose PA Wind in 2015</a>) by Julie Hancher of <a href=\"http://www.greenphillyblog.com\">GreenPhillyBlog</a> today.\n<blockquote>\"Yet Philadelphia doesn’t have to be an energy hub for natural gas and fossil fuels to be a powerhouse – we have the potential to be <em>a clean</em> energy hub right here.\"</blockquote>\nFelt it was an appropriate  start for this site.

This would be tragic for Philadelphia in many ways, and would mark a turning from the green agenda of the Nutter administration backwards toward a 19th century vision of pollution, economic stagnation and accelerating climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThere has been some concern expressed in environmental circles about the presence of Phil Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, on Jim\'s Policy Committee.

We’re delighted with the result, which includes a goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2050.\r\n\r\nWith three world-class policy advisors with extensive policy background on his team, Kenney actually has the expertise and experience at his disposal to move on concrete, doable steps toward this goal. The policy doesn’t just talk about carbon reduction. It lays out specific policy to reduce building energy use, to reduce the emissions from the City fleet, to implement a green (and local) procurement program, to incentivize renewable energy, to encourage more green roof infrastructure, and more!\r\n\r\nWe believe this puts Kenney head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates, even those who claim to support green development but don\'t put forward specific plans and still maintain that a fossil fuel hub can be achieved without environmental sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA week before our crucial meeting with Jim and his team, <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/4/24/grid-endorses-nelson-diaz-for-mayor.html\" target=\"_blank\">GRID magazine endorsed Nelson Diaz</a> for Mayor.  Many of us were disappointed to see this from a local magazine educating our region on sustainability, but found it understandable because Kenney\'s new appointments and policy had not become public. Now, there is no reason not to feel GREAT leaving the voting booth, not wasting a vote on a candidate who can\'t win, but propelling a true champion into office.\r\n\r\nLast we heard, Diaz only had 4% at the polls.  This primary could be won by a narrow margin, so remember that voting for Diaz is taking a vote from Kenney, and handing it to Anthony Williams, the corporate candidate, financed by the fracking industry, school privatizers and anti-Muslim voices.\r\n\r\nWe could continue wringing our hands and complaining about inaction on climate and corruption from our politicians.

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\n\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\n<ol>\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\n</b></li>\n</ol>\nHere are some ideas\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\n<ul>\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\n</b></li>\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\n</ul>\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\n\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\n\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\n<h3>Some local proposals</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li><b><a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">ECA\'s Recommendations for the Next Mayor of Philadelphia</a>: </b>UNLEASH THE POWER OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO GROW PHILADELPHIA’S ECONOMY AND CREATE LOCAL JOBS<a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\">\n</a>A lot of the energy efficiency (EE) work will pay for itself within a year or two.  We\'ve heard about a suburban school implementing EE and saving 40% of their energy cost, which could go right back into the school budget. Would love to see this for PHL schools.</li>\n	<li><b>Philadelphia</b><strong>\'s GreenWorks</strong> program, and the <a href=\"//www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phila.gov%2Fgreen%2FPDFs%2FGreenworksprogressreport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014 progress report</a>\nMayor Nutter\'s GreenWorks plan. The City\'s met quite a few of the targets. But in terms of energy, we haven\'t met the first target (T1). We need to reach the 5 energy targets, and develop an 80% by 2050 plan like other cities, possibly dubbing it Greenworks+.</li>\n	<li>Mayor-Elect Kenney\'s Environment policy, found here.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/essayworks/77323-a-renewable-energy-alternative-to-philadelphias-fossil-fuel-vision\">A renewable-energy alternative to Philadelphia’s fossil fuel vision</a>, excerpts below\n<blockquote>According to <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42306.pdf\">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> data, the Philadelphia region has the potential to install 8,700 megawatts of rooftop solar — equal to about 25 percent of the region\'s energy usage. Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\n</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\n</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-autosave-v1','','','2015-05-30 21:09:00','2015-05-31 01:09:00','',29,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/28/29-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(298,2,'2015-05-28 21:16:03','2015-05-29 01:16:03','<strong> </strong>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>“Going green” is about transitioning to a healthier, cleaner, more livable city, while growing stable, living wage jobs and opportunities for all, built on proven, readily available, clean energy technologies.

In short, it will re-industrialize Philadelphia. Phil Rinaldi is the head of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the corporation responsible for 72% of the toxic air pollution in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFor a good summary of what this plan might mean to Philadelphia, check out Grid Magazine’s expose in their February 2015 issue titled <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/2/25/haunted-by-an-industrial-future.html\" target=\"_blank\">Haunted by an Industrial Future</a>.\r\n\r\nRinaldi’s vision of Philadelphia as an “Energy Hub” is essentially a plan for doubling down on the transport of dirty, dangerous fossil fuel products through Philadelphia in order to process it for sale either domestically or overseas. The \"Energy Hub\" is a corporate agenda currently being worked out in secretive meetings that are closed to the public and, for the most part, even the media. While we applaud the city of Philadelphia\'s commitment to sustainability through policies like Greenworks, we strongly oppose Rinaldi\'s plan as undemocratic and a step in the wrong direction for the future of our city.\r\n<h3>THE RISK FROM “OIL BOMB” TRAINS</h3>\r\nUnbeknownst to many people, Philadelphia already has two or three trains, over a mile long, carrying some of the most volatile fuels known through densely populated neighborhoods every day. These trains consist primarily of outdated tank cars, officially known as <a href=\"http://dot111.info/\" target=\"_blank\">DOT111 cars</a>, that were designed for products like corn oil, and were never meant to carry explosive loads. Also known by such colorful names as “rolling pepsi cans,” and “the Ford Pintos of the rails” these cars are unstable and prone to derail and explode, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/05/oil-tank-trains-bakken-crude-accidents\" target=\"_blank\">causing massive damage and loss of life</a>.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, these “bomb trains” roll through our city daily, over a crumbling rail infrastructure, and particularly over unsafe, poorly maintained bridges. This has already led to <a href=\"http://ucreview.com/shale-oil-trains-bring-danger-to-philadelphia-p5508-112.htm\" target=\"_blank\">two recent near misses</a>. The industry goes to great lengths to hide the facts about these “oil bomb” trains, but it is very hard to hide when the inevitable happens. See <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-02-23/news/59390938_1_oil-trains-open-records-plans\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-train accidents raise concern in Phila</a>, in the February 23rd 2015 Inquirer.\r\n<h3>PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS</h3>\r\nThe Rinaldi plan also means more pipelines, more pollution-belching factories, more toxic fumes, and more asthma and lung disease in a city already plagued by an <a href=\"http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=557612&amp;mode=2\" target=\"_blank\">epidemic of these ailments</a>. The Energy Hub not only represents a public health risk to Philadelphia. The means of obtaining the toxic gas and oil that will flow through our area also poses a risk to people who live in “fracking country,” our fellow Pennsylvanians and people from other states.

What constitutes “safe” to the industry is not always what the actual human beings in the path of these pipelines might consider safe. The danger is to our entire region, not just Philadelphia.

Others say we should just invest fully in renewables. What\'s your view on either of those?\r\n\r\nPR: This is America, people are entitled to their views no matter how idiotic they are. And they are idiotic indeed. … It\'s driven by crazy science. Someone who said that we\'re killing the world and \'gee, if you would only stop burning carbon, the world won\'t die.\' I don\'t think there\'s any evidence that that\'s the case.

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.Curious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n<h3><strong>RESOURCES</strong>\r\n<strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-28 21:31:47','2015-05-29 01:31:47','',29,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/28/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(302,2,'2015-05-28 21:33:18','2015-05-29 01:33:18','Phil Rinaldi\'s “Energy Hub” plan will introduce more pipelines, oil trains, and refineries to Philadelphia. In short, it will re-industrialize Philadelphia. Phil Rinaldi is the head of <a href=\"http://pes-companies.com\" target=\"_blank\">Philadelphia Energy Solutions</a>, the corporation responsible for 72% of the toxic air pollution in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFor a good summary of what this plan might mean to Philadelphia, check out Grid Magazine’s expose in their February 2015 issue titled <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/2/25/haunted-by-an-industrial-future.html\" target=\"_blank\">Haunted by an Industrial Future</a>.\r\n\r\nRinaldi’s vision of Philadelphia as an “Energy Hub” is essentially a plan for doubling down on the transport of dirty, dangerous fossil fuel products through Philadelphia in order to process it for sale either domestically or overseas. The \"Energy Hub\" is a corporate agenda currently being worked out in secretive meetings that are closed to the public and, for the most part, even the media. While we applaud the city of Philadelphia\'s commitment to sustainability through policies like Greenworks, we strongly oppose Rinaldi\'s plan as undemocratic and a step in the wrong direction for the future of our city.\r\n<h3>THE RISK FROM “OIL BOMB” TRAINS</h3>\r\nUnbeknownst to many people, Philadelphia already has two or three trains, over a mile long, carrying some of the most volatile fuels known through densely populated neighborhoods every day. These trains consist primarily of outdated tank cars, officially known as <a href=\"http://dot111.info/\" target=\"_blank\">DOT111 cars</a>, that were designed for products like corn oil, and were never meant to carry explosive loads. Also known by such colorful names as “rolling pepsi cans,” and “the Ford Pintos of the rails” these cars are unstable and prone to derail and explode, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/05/oil-tank-trains-bakken-crude-accidents\" target=\"_blank\">causing massive damage and loss of life</a>.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, these “bomb trains” roll through our city daily, over a crumbling rail infrastructure, and particularly over unsafe, poorly maintained bridges. This has already led to <a href=\"http://ucreview.com/shale-oil-trains-bring-danger-to-philadelphia-p5508-112.htm\" target=\"_blank\">two recent near misses</a>. The industry goes to great lengths to hide the facts about these “oil bomb” trains, but it is very hard to hide when the inevitable happens. See <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-02-23/news/59390938_1_oil-trains-open-records-plans\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-train accidents raise concern in Phila</a>, in the February 23rd 2015 Inquirer.\r\n<h3>PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS</h3>\r\nThe Rinaldi plan also means more pipelines, more pollution-belching factories, more toxic fumes, and more asthma and lung disease in a city already plagued by an <a href=\"http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=557612&amp;mode=2\" target=\"_blank\">epidemic of these ailments</a>. The Energy Hub not only represents a public health risk to Philadelphia. The means of obtaining the toxic gas and oil that will flow through our area also poses a risk to people who live in “fracking country,” our fellow Pennsylvanians and people from other states. See PDF titled <a href=\"http://www.lwvny.org/advocacy/issues/2011/HydraulicFracturing_060211.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Hearing on the Health Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing Techniques (PDF)</a>\r\n<h3>HOW ABOUT PIPELINES?</h3>\r\nDespite the proven health risks, pipelines are touted as a “safer” way to move gas and oil, but to some, pipelines are just a way of hiding the danger underground. What constitutes “safe” to the industry is not always what the actual human beings in the path of these pipelines might consider safe. The danger is to our entire region, not just Philadelphia.

Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub.

In short, it will re-industrialize Philadelphia. Phil Rinaldi is the head of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the corporation responsible for 72% of the toxic air pollution in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFor a good summary of what this plan might mean to Philadelphia, check out Grid Magazine’s expose in their February 2015 issue titled <a href=\"http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2015/2/25/haunted-by-an-industrial-future.html\" target=\"_blank\">Haunted by an Industrial Future</a>.\r\n\r\nRinaldi’s vision of Philadelphia as an “Energy Hub” is essentially a plan for doubling down on the transport of dirty, dangerous fossil fuel products through Philadelphia in order to process it for sale either domestically or overseas. The \"Energy Hub\" is a corporate agenda currently being worked out in secretive meetings that are closed to the public and, for the most part, even the media. While we applaud the city of Philadelphia\'s commitment to sustainability through policies like Greenworks, we strongly oppose Rinaldi\'s plan as undemocratic and a step in the wrong direction for the future of our city.\r\n<h3>THE RISK FROM “OIL BOMB” TRAINS</h3>\r\nUnbeknownst to many people, Philadelphia already has two or three trains, over a mile long, carrying some of the most volatile fuels known through densely populated neighborhoods every day. These trains consist primarily of outdated tank cars, officially known as <a href=\"http://dot111.info/\" target=\"_blank\">DOT111 cars</a>, that were designed for products like corn oil, and were never meant to carry explosive loads. Also known by such colorful names as “rolling pepsi cans,” and “the Ford Pintos of the rails” these cars are unstable and prone to derail and explode, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/05/oil-tank-trains-bakken-crude-accidents\" target=\"_blank\">causing massive damage and loss of life</a>.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, these “bomb trains” roll through our city daily, over a crumbling rail infrastructure, and particularly over unsafe, poorly maintained bridges. This has already led to <a href=\"http://ucreview.com/shale-oil-trains-bring-danger-to-philadelphia-p5508-112.htm\" target=\"_blank\">two recent near misses</a>. The industry goes to great lengths to hide the facts about these “oil bomb” trains, but it is very hard to hide when the inevitable happens.

The Energy Hub not only represents a public health risk to Philadelphia. The means of obtaining the toxic gas and oil that will flow through our area also poses a risk to people who live in “fracking country,” our fellow Pennsylvanians and people from other states. See PDF titled <a href=\"http://www.lwvny.org/advocacy/issues/2011/HydraulicFracturing_060211.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Hearing on the Health Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing Techniques (PDF)</a>\r\n<h3>HOW ABOUT PIPELINES?</h3>\r\nDespite the proven health risks, pipelines are touted as a “safer” way to move gas and oil, but to some, pipelines are just a way of hiding the danger underground. What constitutes “safe” to the industry is not always what the actual human beings in the path of these pipelines might consider safe. The danger is to our entire region, not just Philadelphia.

Others say we should just invest fully in renewables. What\'s your view on either of those?\r\n\r\nPR: This is America, people are entitled to their views no matter how idiotic they are. And they are idiotic indeed. … It\'s driven by crazy science. Someone who said that we\'re killing the world and \'gee, if you would only stop burning carbon, the world won\'t die.\' I don\'t think there\'s any evidence that that\'s the case. I don\'t think it\'s very practical.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/morning_roundup/2015/02/q-a-with-phil-rinaldi-on-philadelphia-as-an-energy.html?page=all\" target=\"_blank\">View Full Interview</a>\r\n\r\nBecome a part of a <em>Bright Philly Future</em>. <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/get-involved/\" target=\"_blank\">Join the Conversation</a>.','What is the energy hub and why do we oppose it?','','inherit','open','open','','299-revision-v1','','','2015-05-28 23:18:34','2015-05-29 03:18:34','',299,'http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/05/28/299-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(320,1,'2015-05-29 15:33:00','2015-05-29 19:33:00','Bright Philly Future is the educational and resources arm of a coalition of forward-looking organizations in Philadelphia and the surrounding region, committed to bringing about a just and democratic transition to a sustainable future based on clean, renewable energy, stable living-wage jobs and an economy that works for all.\r\n\r\nOn this website you can educate yourself about the issues that face our city, our region and our world, connect to the organizations and campaigns that are making a difference, and learn how you can get involved at any level from improving your health and saving money by lowering your own carbon footprint to joining any one of dozens of campaigns, events and groups working together for a Bright Philly Future.','About Us','','inherit','open','open','','208-revision-v1','','','2015-05-29 15:33:00','2015-05-29 19:33:00','',208,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/29/208-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(321,2,'2015-05-30 19:34:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2015-05-30 19:34:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/?p=321',0,'post','',0),(322,2,'2015-05-30 20:09:35','2015-05-31 00:09:35','“Going green” is about transitioning to a healthier, cleaner, more livable city, while growing stable, living wage jobs and opportunities for all, built on proven, readily available, clean energy technologies. In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\r\n<h3><b>On the power of Cities</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/john-kerry-knows-cities-hold-the-key-to-fighting-climate-change/\">John Kerry knows cities hold the key to fighting climate change</a>\r\n<blockquote>“A lot of mayors around the world are ahead of their national governments, and a lot of local citizens are well ahead of their elected leaders,” “..cities are responsible for <a href=\"http://mirror.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/E_Hot_Cities.pdf\">70 percent of the world’s carbon emissions</a>.\"</blockquote>\r\nAnd cities are simply better equipped to turn talk into action.This article has a reference to Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda signed by Nutter, and platform of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What other cities are doing</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>New York City\'s <a href=\"http://www.alignny.org/posts/uncategorized/2014/12/climate-works-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Works for All</a></b><b>\r\n</b>We particularly like their focus on reducing emissions.

Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-30 20:09:35','2015-05-31 00:09:35','',29,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/30/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(323,2,'2015-04-30 20:28:56','2015-05-01 00:28:56','Cities have a major role to play in the global mobilization to mitigate and avert climate disasters, and cities world-wide are stepping up to the task.\r\n\r\nThe Scientific American writes <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-be-solved-in-cities-or-not-at-all/\" target=\"_blank\">Cities will solve climate change, not nations</a>.\r\n\r\nAs does The Guardian, in this article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cities-bypass-government-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">Cities bypass slow government to lead the way on climate change</a>.\r\n\r\nEven <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/john-kerry-knows-cities-hold-the-key-to-fighting-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\">John Kerry knows cities hold the key to fighting climate change</a>, where he says \"A lot of mayors around the world are ahead of their national governments, and a lot of local citizens are well ahead of their elected leaders,\", reminding us that “..cities are responsible for <a href=\"http://mirror.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/E_Hot_Cities.pdf\">70 percent of the world’s carbon emissions</a>. And cities are simply better equipped to turn talk into action.\" This article has a reference to Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda signed by Philadelphia Mayor Nutter, and platform of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.\r\n\r\nWhat are other cities are doing?

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA.

Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-30 20:38:24','2015-05-31 00:38:24','',29,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/30/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(326,2,'2015-05-30 20:39:43','2015-05-31 00:39:43','Cities have a major role to play in the global mobilization to mitigate and avert climate disasters, and cities world-wide are stepping up to the task.\n\nThe Scientific American writes <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-be-solved-in-cities-or-not-at-all/\" target=\"_blank\">Cities will solve climate change, not nations</a>.\n\nAs does The Guardian, in this article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cities-bypass-government-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">Cities bypass slow government to lead the way on climate change</a>.\n\nEven <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/john-kerry-knows-cities-hold-the-key-to-fighting-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\">John Kerry knows cities hold the key to fighting climate change</a>, where he says \"A lot of mayors around the world are ahead of their national governments, and a lot of local citizens are well ahead of their elected leaders,\", reminding us that “..cities are responsible for <a href=\"http://mirror.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/E_Hot_Cities.pdf\">70 percent of the world’s carbon emissions</a>. And cities are simply better equipped to turn talk into action.\" This article has a reference to Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda signed by Philadelphia Mayor Nutter, and platform of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.\n\nWhat are other cities are doing?

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\r\n<h3>Jobs</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/oil_and_gas_vs_clean_energy_jobs_setting_the_record_straight/\">Oil &amp; Gas Jobs vs Clean Energy Jobs</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Some local proposals</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b><a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">ECA\'s Recommendations for the Next Mayor of Philadelphia</a>: </b>UNLEASH THE POWER OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO GROW PHILADELPHIA’S ECONOMY AND CREATE LOCAL JOBS<a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\">\r\n</a>A lot of the energy efficiency (EE) work will pay for itself within a year or two.  We\'ve heard about a suburban school implementing EE and saving 40% of their energy cost, which could go right back into the school budget.

The City\'s met quite a few of the targets. But in terms of energy, we haven\'t met the first target (T1).

Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-30 20:41:23','2015-05-31 00:41:23','',29,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/30/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(329,2,'2015-04-29 20:42:31','2015-04-30 00:42:31','A green economy is a job-friendly economy and accounts for more jobs than a fossil fuel based economy.

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\r\n<h3>Some local proposals</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b><a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">ECA\'s Recommendations for the Next Mayor of Philadelphia</a>: </b>UNLEASH THE POWER OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO GROW PHILADELPHIA’S ECONOMY AND CREATE LOCAL JOBS<a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\">\r\n</a>A lot of the energy efficiency (EE) work will pay for itself within a year or two.  We\'ve heard about a suburban school implementing EE and saving 40% of their energy cost, which could go right back into the school budget.

The City\'s met quite a few of the targets. But in terms of energy, we haven\'t met the first target (T1). We need to reach the 5 energy targets, and develop an 80% by 2050 plan like other cities, possibly dubbing it Greenworks+.</li>\r\n	<li>Mayor-Elect Kenney\'s Environment policy, found here.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/essayworks/77323-a-renewable-energy-alternative-to-philadelphias-fossil-fuel-vision\">A renewable-energy alternative to Philadelphia’s fossil fuel vision</a>, excerpts below\r\n<blockquote>According to <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42306.pdf\">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> data, the Philadelphia region has the potential to install 8,700 megawatts of rooftop solar — equal to about 25 percent of the region\'s energy usage. Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-30 20:59:03','2015-05-31 00:59:03','',29,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/30/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(332,2,'2015-05-30 21:04:44','2015-05-31 01:04:44','A green economy is a job-friendly economy and accounts for more jobs than a fossil fuel based economy.

In contrast, the dirty fossil fuel “Energy Hub” plan is about turning back the clock to the 19th century, and writing off our city as an environmental “sacrifice zone” for the short-term profit of some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Philadelphia, we need to\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements,</li>\r\n	<li>strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings, and</li>\r\n	<li>consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.  <b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHere are some examples of each.\r\n<h4>1. Change our City\'s role in the energy marketplace</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Municipal (group) power purchasing/ community choice aggregation\r\n</b>Communities participating in the Sustainable Westchester coalition are going to be able to purchase power as a municipal group and offer it to their citizens.  People can choose to participate and purchase from the town, or stay in the usual arrangement and buy from the utility.   More <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8563054/state-approves-westchester-power-experiment\">here</a>. Philadelphia could investigate pursuing an agreement like this with PECO.  Lowering energy prices through a group purchase in conjunction with switching to REC powered electricity would really allow for a wider market signal in favor of renewables without a big cost increase.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Virtual net metering/community renewables\r\n</b>DC recently passed a community renewables energy act giving utility rate payers access to virtual net-metering. Virtual net-metering permits anyone to subscribe to a solar installation. Once they have done so, the electricity produced by their portion of the solar installation is credited to their monthly electric bill.  More <a href=\"http://www.dcsun.org/community-renewables-energy-act-of-2013/\">here</a>.  This has not come into effect yet, but the relevant agency is in final rulemaking.  What is really cool about this is it offers an opportunity for low income renters (for example) to participate by investing in solar facilities, and the design of this (last I heard) contemplated assistance for low income families so all could participate in a sustainable future as buyers, builders, and investors.  DC\'s effort is locally focused, so all the installations that produce energy have to be located in the city, producing local jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Strengthen incentives for energy efficient &amp; renewable improvements</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/local/showcase/student-conservation-corps.html\">Student Conservation Corps: Building a New Energy Foundation</a> - EPA &amp; West Chester Area School District - $300k project cost, $281k saved annually on electric bill. Let\'s do this in Philly! We can\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Save energy and money desperately needed for education</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs in weatherization &amp; energy efficiency</li>\r\n	<li>Train students for jobs as solar panel installers</li>\r\n	<li>Outreach and weatherization projects for low income homeowners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Strengthen disclosure requirements for commercial &amp; residential buildings</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R<b>esidential energy use disclosure ordinance</b>\r\nAustin has instituted an <a href=\"http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/ecad-ordinance/energy-conservation-audit-and-disclosure-ordinance/%21ut/p/a1/jZAxT8MwFIR_S4eMjo0rwGUzpgqhlEykIUvlJq-OpdSObKcR_HpSWChqoW876bt7usMlLnBp5F4rGbQ1sj3o8mZNKKOPgtA0uaWM8ETcL67zl6sZIyPw9hPI5tkDSfMs59lCkERML_SfOU7-8z9d8IC6pVgqXHYyNEibrcUFGHDqHVXWeHD7r7ZI9rUOSJoa1dpXrfW9A2RdrY00FRyCuNlM2RjkYAsOXNy7caEmhM7fRSQiwzDEylrVQlzZXUROWRrrAy6OSbzC5V81-Jz-Bk7s_A2cH7LbvRYfz7BiYZZqPpl8AjKatdw%21/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\">Energy Conservation Audit &amp; Disclosure Ordinance</a> that requires homebuyers to disclose the energy use of their home through an audit.  This provides information to prospective buyers on the home\'s energy purchase.  By getting the information out there in relation to the purchase process, this is an important step towards moving to a real estate appraisal process that actually incorporates energy performance.  By over time allowing homebuyers to make decisions that lead to sale prices that are higher due to efficiency features, future appraisals can start to incorporate these market comps into play.  ACEEE has a policy brief here.  If we can make it easier for the market to reflect the increased values of residential properties that have renewable/energy efficient features, that provides even more motivation for homeowners to upgrade.  As a potential policy, this could always be designed to minimize the impact on low income households by making audits free for certain income thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. Consider financing mechanisms for green projects that address market failures.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b>Sustainable Energy Utility\r\n</b>The <a href=\"https://www.dcseu.com/about-dcseu\">DC Sustainable Energy Utility</a> is a private company under contract to the District Department of the Environment, which administers rebates that are funded by a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund, financed by a tax on all electric and natural gas utility ratepayers.  Rather than rely on different utilities offering different incentives, DC SEU sort of offers them all, with a very user friendly interface to homeowners.  It has gotten some rave reviews already and could be a model for Philadelphia.  This hypothetical entity could help to address the challenges in coordinating energy retrofits.<b>\r\n</b></li>\r\n	<li><b>PennSEF &amp; FREE\r\n</b>The Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program is a partnership between the PA Treasury Dept and FREE (the Foundation for Renewable Energy &amp; Environment), to provide technical and legal assistance, as well as low-cost capital, for energy improvement projects by municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. More <a href=\"http://freefutures.org/pennsef/about\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Green Bank</b>\r\nNew York State has recently started a <a href=\"http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview\">green bank</a> that invests in green flavored projects of many types, seeking to put capital in play where private markets are unwilling to do so and establish proven models to facilitate private investment, as NRDC details on this blog <a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsims/first_new_york_green_bank_deal.html\">post</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/\">Connecticut</a> also has one.  I know of at least one county that is considering doing a green bank on the local level.  I think the next mayor could pursue this idea, either in terms of talking with the state to implement one at a statewide level (the best way forward), or possibly implementing a local version.</li>\r\n	<li><b>Commercial PACE</b>\r\nIt would be great to see the next mayor advocate with the state for Commercial PACE enabling legislation so it is easier for commercial buildings to finance retrofits through property assessments.  <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/make-pace-happen/\">PA is one of only 22 states without enabling legislation</a>, and every state to our Northeast (including NJ and NY) has it - but that is a bit out of the mayor\'s direct control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCurious about the fossil fuel energy hub and why we oppose it? <a href=\"http://brightphillyfuture.bowersad.com/index.php/2015/02/23/what-is-the-energy-hub-and-why-do-we-oppose-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read on</a>.\r\n\r\nHow do we intend to power ourselves if we\'re rejecting fossil fuels? From web <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/solutions\">page</a> of a local group (Energy Justice Network),\r\n<blockquote>\"When it comes to materials management, the simplified solution can be summed up as the three R\'s -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are in priority order.  The equivalent in the energy world is Conservation, Efficiency and Clean Renewables\".</blockquote>\r\nSee their <a href=\"http://www.energyjustice.net/files/technologies.pdf\">one page chart</a> for recommended hierarchy of waste management &amp; energy production (from cleanest to dirtiest). So when we speak of clean energy, we aren\'t just talking about solar panels; implied is Conservation, Efficiency, and then Clean Renewable Energy like Solar &amp; Wind.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can actually power ourselves by solar &amp; wind, see <a href=\"http://thesolutionsproject.org/#tsp-section-map\">this infographic by the Solutions Project</a>, and zoom into PA. The data is from a Stanford University research. They\'re actively developing a more detailed roadmap for New York State.\r\n<h3>Some local proposals</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><b><a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">ECA\'s Recommendations for the Next Mayor of Philadelphia</a>: </b>UNLEASH THE POWER OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO GROW PHILADELPHIA’S ECONOMY AND CREATE LOCAL JOBS<a href=\"https://www.ecasavesenergy.org/ecas-recommendations-next-mayor-philadelphia\">\r\n</a>A lot of the energy efficiency (EE) work will pay for itself within a year or two.  We\'ve heard about a suburban school implementing EE and saving 40% of their energy cost, which could go right back into the school budget.

The City\'s met quite a few of the targets. But in terms of energy, we haven\'t met the first target (T1). We need to reach the 5 energy targets, and develop an 80% by 2050 plan like other cities, possibly dubbing it Greenworks+.</li>\r\n	<li>Mayor-Elect Kenney\'s Environment policy, found here.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/essayworks/77323-a-renewable-energy-alternative-to-philadelphias-fossil-fuel-vision\">A renewable-energy alternative to Philadelphia’s fossil fuel vision</a>, excerpts below\r\n<blockquote>According to <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42306.pdf\">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> data, the Philadelphia region has the potential to install 8,700 megawatts of rooftop solar — equal to about 25 percent of the region\'s energy usage. Over 20 years, this equates to $1.3 billion annually in direct economic activity and $1.95 billion annually in indirect economic benefits for the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia could potentially get about 5 percent of this <a href=\"http://pv.energytrend.com/knowledge/Energy_Solar_USA.html\">economic activity</a>, or about $97.5 million, in the form of property, sales and wage taxes. By 2035, solar energy could annually provide more than 4,000 direct, well-paid jobs to local workers.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Energy efficiency is also a key part of turning our city into a renewable energy hub. Efficiency like weatherization has immediate environmental, health and climate benefits, saves people money on electricity bills, and provides many local construction jobs. Jobs in energy efficiency can take advantage of the existing local workforce, and the work is much more job intensive than the natural gas industry. The <a href=\"http://www.energywisepa.org/sites/energywisepa.org/files/ACEEE%20Report.PDF\">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy completed a study</a> in 2009 that found that with the right policies, installation of energy efficiency and solar measures could spur the growth of at least 9,000 jobs in Philadelphia by 2025.</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Transportation</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://issuu.com/bicyclecoalition/docs/bettermobility012215.final/11?e=15252922/11076193\">Better Mobility - Philadelphia 2015</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SaferStreets.Final_.12.5.141.pdf\">Safer Streets</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>On Fiscal Transparency </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increase fiscal transparency and making metrics available online. <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/open-data-pittsburgh\">This article</a> highlights how Pittsburgh and NYC have very inexpensively made their budgets easy to use online.  Could be used for energy, as recommended by the ECA, to track energy consumption patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p93falr\">The White House wants to explore how climate change makes you sick</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Policy</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/np777x9\">Switching to 100% renewables by 2050 would save major fossil economies $500 billion\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q2aqkwq\">Solar Panels Or Greenery Required For Every New Building Rooftop In France\r\n</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/m85cu5s\">Teens\' climate-change suit hits court with call to protect our air</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','Policy','','inherit','open','open','','29-revision-v1','','','2015-05-30 21:09:27','2015-05-31 01:09:27','',29,'http://www.brightphillyfuture.org/index.php/2015/05/30/29-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(336,2,'2015-05-31 14:09:20','2015-05-31 18:09:20','Yesterday\'s post in the Inquirer titled <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20150530_Feds_won_t_weaken_oil-train_public_disclosure_rules.html\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. won\'t weaken oil-train public disclosure rules</a> was heartening.  The Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration referred to transparency when they denied the railroads request to keep railroad data about large volumes of crude oil exempt from Freedom of Information Act and not even tell first responders, let alone the public. They said that\r\n<blockquote>\"transparency is a critical piece of the federal government\'s comprehensive approach to safety,\" the agency said it supported \"the public disclosure of this information to the extent allowed by applicable state, local, and tribal laws.\"</blockquote>\r\nAnother heartening piece of news is the energy policy of Jim Kenney, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Philadelphia.

Thanks to their organizing, the city government is already making important changes, and Mayor de Blasio has announced an ambitious plan for promoting economic and environmental justice.\r\n\r\nThe Climate Works for All coalition has created a 10-point platform that calls for retrofitting all of NYC\'s large buildings to be more energy efficient, installing solar panels on 100 public schools, expanding public transportation, and seven other projects. Together, these initiatives would create nearly 40,000 living wage jobs and move NYC one third of the way toward the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who:</strong> Key leaders from NYC have generously offered to share their plans, ideas, and experience with us.

They said that\r\n<blockquote>\"transparency is a critical piece of the federal government\'s comprehensive approach to safety,\" the agency said it supported \"the public disclosure of this information to the extent allowed by applicable state, local, and tribal laws.\"</blockquote>\r\nAnother heartening piece of news is the energy policy of Jim Kenney, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Philadelphia. His <a href=\"https://kenney2015.com/media-releases/kenney-2015-releases-environment-transportation-policy-paper\" target=\"_blank\">May 4th press release</a> refers to an\r\n<blockquote>\"open and democratic process for any decisions made about the economic development and energy future of our city, a process that is based on the best data available and that includes our neighborhood associations, local businesses, working people and citizen groups.\"</blockquote>\r\nHere Mr Kenney also noted that\r\n<blockquote>\"We do not need to pit good jobs and a thriving economy against clean air, clean water and the health of our children. We can and must have both.\"</blockquote>\r\nOn that note, we\'d like to share what New York City groups have done.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.alignny.org\" target=\"_blank\">ALIGN</a> (Alliance for a Greater New York) had a forum this past December called Climate Works for All where they released a document called <a href=\"http://www.alignny.org/posts/uncategorized/2014/12/climate-works-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Works for All: </a><em><a href=\"http://www.alignny.org/posts/uncategorized/2014/12/climate-works-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">A Platform for Reducing Emissions, Protecting Our Communities, and Creating Good Jobs for New Yorkers</a>.  </em>We particularly like their focus on reducing emissions. And involvement with unions. And would love to implement Large Building Energy Efficiency Retrofits, as explained in Chapter 2, and installing Solar on the 100 largest schools, as explained on Chapter 5.\r\n\r\nThree of the people behind the NYC effort will be speaking here in Philadelphia this Tuesday, the evening of June 2nd. We\'d like to invite all to this event, to initiate discussions about our energy future. Details below.\r\n<blockquote><strong>Event</strong>: Labor, Community &amp; the Climate Crisis: Building Alliances for Economic &amp; Environmental Justice\r\n<strong>When: </strong>Tue June 2 6:30-8:30pm - Doors open at 6:00 pm - Snacks will be provided.<strong>\r\nWhere: </strong>IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) Local 98, 1719 Spring Garden St, Philadelphia, PA 19130\r\n<strong>What</strong>: Learn about <strong>Climate Works for All</strong> - the groundbreaking effort out of New York City where unions, environmental and community groups have joined in coalition to create policies that will create thousands of good jobs, dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions, promote racial justice, and make the city more resilient. Thanks to their organizing, the city government is already making important changes, and Mayor de Blasio has announced an ambitious plan for promoting economic and environmental justice.\r\n\r\nThe Climate Works for All coalition has created a 10-point platform that calls for retrofitting all of NYC\'s large buildings to be more energy efficient, installing solar panels on 100 public schools, expanding public transportation, and seven other projects.
